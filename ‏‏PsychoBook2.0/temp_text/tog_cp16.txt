Nassun
sits
office
within
the
Antarctic
Fulcrum
suddenly
understanding
her
mother
better
than
ever
before
Schaffa
and
Umber
sit
either
side
her
All
three
them
are
holding
cups
safe
that
the
Fulcrum
people
have
offered
them
Nida
back
Found
Moon
because
someone
must
remain
watch
over
the
children
there
and
because
she
has
the
hardest
time
emulating
normal
human
behavior
Umber
quiet
that
one
knows
what
thinking
Schaffa
doing
all
the
talking
They
been
invited
inside
speak
with
three
people
who
are
called
cseniors
whatever
that
means
These
seniors
wear
uniforms
that
are
all
black
with
neatly
buttoned
jackets
and
pleated
slacks
that
why
they
call
Imperial
Orogenes
blackjackets
They
feel
all
over
power
and
fear
One
them
obviously
Antarctic
bred
with
graying
red
hair
and
skin
white
that
green
veins
show
starkly
just
underneath
She
has
horsey
teeth
and
beautiful
lips
and
Nassun
cannot
stop
staring
both
she
talks
Her
name
Serpentine
which
does
not
seem
fit
her
all
cOf
course
have
new
grits
coming
Serpentine
says
For
some
reason
she
looks
Nassun
she
speaks
and
spreads
her
hands
The
fingers
shake
slightly
That
been
happening
since
this
meeting
began
cIt
difficulty
hadn
quite
anticipated
nothing
else
means
have
grit
dormitories
going
unused
time
when
safe
shelter
quite
valuable
That
would
why
extended
offer
nearby
comms
take
their
unparented
children
those
too
young
have
earned
acceptance
into
comm
Only
sensible
yes
And
took
few
refugees
which
would
why
had
choice
but
open
trade
negotiations
with
the
locals
for
supplies
and
such
With

coming
from
Yumenes
Her
expression
falters
cWell

isn
She
whining
Doing
with
gracious
smile
and
impeccable
manners
doing
with
two
other
people
nodding
sagely
along
with
her
but
doing
Nassun
isn
sure
why
these
people
bother
her
much
has
something
with
the
whining
and
with
the
falseness
them:
They
are
clearly
uncomfortable
with
the
arrival
Guardians
clearly
afraid
and
angry
and
yet
they
pretend
courtesy
makes
her
think
her
mother
who
pretended
kind
and
loving
when
Father
anyone
else
was
around
and
who
was
cold
and
fierce
private
Thinking
the
Antarctic
Fulcrum
place
populated
endless
variants
her
mother
makes
Nassun
teeth
and
palms
and
sessapinae
itch
And
she
can
see
the
icy
placidity
Umber
face
and
the
brittle
edged
friendliness
Schaffa
smile
that
the
Guardians
don
like
either
cUnderstandable
indeed
Schaffa
says
turns
the
cup
safe
his
hands
The
cloudy
solution
has
remained
white
should
but
hasn
taken
single
sip
imagine
the
local
comms
are
grateful
you
for
housing
and
feeding
their
surplus
population
And
only
sensible
that
you
would
put
those
people
work
too

your
fields

smiles
more
widely
cGardens
mean
Serpentine
smiles
back
and
her
companions
shift
uncomfortably
something
Nassun
doesn
understand
The
Season
hasn
yet
taken
full
hold
here
the
Antarctic
region
does
seem
wise
that
comm
would
plant
its
greenland
and
put
Strongbacks
its
walls
and
start
preparing
for
the
worst
Somehow
bad
that
the
Antarctic
Fulcrum
has
done
this
however
Bad
that
this
Fulcrum
functional
all
Nassun
has
stopped
drinking
the
cup
safe
the
seniors
gave
her
even
though
she
only
had
safe
couple
times
before
and
sort
likes
being
treated
like
grown
but
Schaffa
isn
drinking
and
that
warns
her
the
situation
not
really
safe
One
the
seniors
Somidlats
woman
who
could
pass
for
relative
Nassun
tall
middling
brown
curling
thick
hair
body
that
thick
waisted
and
broad
hipped
and
heavy
thighed
They
introduced
her
but
Nassun
can
remember
her
name
Her
orogeny
feels
the
sharpest
the
three
though
she
the
youngest
there
are
six
rings
her
long
fingers
And
she
the
one
who
finally
stops
smiling
and
folds
her
hands
and
lifts
her
chin
just
little
another
thing
that
reminds
Nassun
her
mother
Mama
often
held
herself
the
same
way
feeling
soft
dignity
layered
over
core
diamond
obstinacy
The
obstinacy
what
comes
the
fore
now
the
woman
says
take
you
are
unhappy
Guardian
Serpentine
winces
The
other
Fulcrum
orogene
man
who
introduced
himself
Lamprophyre
sighs
Schaffa
and
Umber
heads
tilt
near
unison
Schaffa
smile
widening
with
interest
cNot
unhappy
says
Nassun
can
tell
that
pleased
done
with
the
pleasantry
cMerely
surprised
after
all
standard
protocol

down

cDeclared
whom
the
six
ringed

asks
cUntil
your

today
there
have
been

here
declare
anything
the
sort
The
local
comm
Leaderships
have
varied:
Some
declared
Seasonal
Law
some
are
only
lockdown
some
are
business
usual
cAnd
had
they
all
declared
Seasonal
Law
Schaffa
says
that
very
quiet
voice
uses
when
knows
the
answer
question
already
and
only
wants
hear
you
say
yourself
cwould
you
truly
have
all
killed
yourselves
Since
you
note
there
are
Guardians
here
take
care
the
matter
for
you
Nassun
catches
herself
before
she
would
have
started
surprise
Kill
themselves
But
she
not
quite
good
enough
controlling
her
orogeny

from
twitching
where
she
does
not
All
three
the
Fulcrum
people
glance
her
and
Serpentine
smiles
thinly
cCareful

she
says
looking
Nassun
but
speaking
Schaffa
cYour
pet
seems
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
mass
extermination
for
reason
Schaffa
says
hide
nothing
from
her
and
Nassun
surprise
swallowed
love
and
pride
glances
Nassun
cHistorically
the
Fulcrum
has
survived
the
sufferance
its
neighbors
depending
the
walls
and
resources
comms
nearby
And
with
all
who
have
viable
use
during
Season
there
most
certainly
expectation
that
Imperial
Orogenes
will
remove
themselves
from
the
competition
for
resources
that
normal
healthy
people
have
better
chance
survive

are
not
permitted

outside
the
supervision
Guardian
the
Fulcrum
spreads
his

cWe
are

Fulcrum
Guardian
says
the
third
senior
whose
name
Nassun
has
forgotten
This
man
from
some
Western
Coastal
people
slender
and
straight
haired
and
has
high
cheekboned
nearly
concave
face
His
skin
white
too
but
his
eyes
are
dark
and
cool
His
orogeny
feels
light
and
many
layered
like
mica
cAnd
are
self
sufficient
Quite
apart
from
being

resources

needed
services
the
nearby
communities
have
even
unasked
and
uncompensated
worked
mitigate
the
aftershakes
the
Rifting
the
occasions
when
they
reach
this
far
south
because
that
few
Antarctic
comms
have
suffered
serious
harm
since
the
start
this
Season
cAdmirable
says
Umber
cAnd
clever
making
yourselves
invaluable
Not
thing
your
Guardians
would
have
permitted
though
imagine
All
three
the
seniors
grow
still
for
moment
cThis

Guardian
says
Serpentine
She
smiles

for

They
are

tense
these

that
makes
the
itch
the
back
Nassun
mind
grow
cWe
endured
several
raids
commless
bands
before
finally
put
wall
Serpentine
says
cThey
died
bravely
protecting
blatant
lie
that
Nassun
stares
her
mouth
open
cWell
Schaffa
says
setting
down
his
cup
safe
and
letting
out
little
sigh
suppose
this
went
about
well
could
expected
And
even
though
Nassun
has
guessed
now
what
coming
even
though
she
has
seen
Schaffa
move
with
speed
that
not
humanly
possible
before
even
though
the
silver
within
him
and
Umber
ignites
like
matchflame
and
blazes
through
them
the
instant
just
before
she
still
caught
off
guard
when
Schaffa
lunges
forward
and
puts
his
fist
through
Serpentine
face
Serpentine
orogeny
dies
she
does
But
the
other
two
seniors
are
and
moving
the
next
instant
Lamprophyre
falling
backward
over
his
chair
escape
Umber
blurring
reach
for
him
and
the
six
ringed
woman
drawing
blowgun
from
one
sleeve
Schaffa
eyes
widen
but
his
hand
still
stuck
Serpentine
tries
lunge
her
but
the
corpse
deadweight
his
arm
She
lifts
the
gun
her
lips
Before
she
can
get
off
puff
Nassun
and
the
earth
and
beginning
spin

that
will

the
woman
instant
The
woman
jerks
surprise
and
flexes
something
that
shatters
Nassun

before
can
form
completely
thing
her
mother
used
during
their
practices
Nassun
did
something
she
wasn
supposed
The
shock
this
realization
causes
Nassun
stagger
and
stumble
back
Her
mother
learned
that
trick
here
the
Fulcrum
this
how
people
from
the
Fulcrum
train
young
orogenes
everything
Nassun
has
known
her
mother
tainted
this
place
and
has
always
been
But
the
fleeting
distraction
enough
Schaffa
rips
his
hand
free
the
corpse
last
and
across
the
room
another
breath
grabbing
the
blowgun
and
snatching
away
and
stabbing
into
the
woman
throat
before
she
can
recover
She
falls
her
knees
choking
reaching
instinctively
for
the
earth
but
then
something
sweeps
the
room
wave
and
Nassun
gasps
when
suddenly
she
cannot
sess
single
thing
The
woman
gasps
too
then
wheezes
scrabbling
her
throat
Schaffa
grabs
her
head
and
breaks
her
neck
with
swift
jerk
Lamprophyre
scrambling
backward
Umber
stalks
him
fumbling
his
clothing
where
some
kind
small
heavy
object
has
gotten
lodged
cloth
cEvil
Earth
blurts
jerking
the
buttons
his
jacket
cYou
contaminated
Both
you
gets
further
though
because
Umber
blurs
and
Nassun
flinches
something
splatters
her
cheek
Umber
has
stomped
the
man
head
cNassun
Schaffa
says
releasing
the
six
ringed
woman
body
and
staring
down
cgo
the
terrace
and
wait
for
there
yes
Schaffa
Nassun
says
She
swallows
She
shaking
She
makes
herself
turn
despite
this
and
walk
out
the
room
There
are
approximately
twenty
two
other
ringed
orogenes
around
somewhere
after
all
Serpentine
said
The
Antarctic
Fulcrum
isn
much
bigger
than
the
town
Jekity
Nassun
leaving
the
big
two
story
house
that
serves
the
administrative
building
There
also
cluster
tiny
cottages
that
apparently
the
older
orogenes
live
and
several
long
barracks
near
the
big
glass
walled
greenhouse
Lots
people
are
around
moving
and
out
the
barracks
and
cottages
Few
them
wear
black
even
though
some
the
civilian
dressed
ones
feel
like
orogenes
Beyond
the
greenhouse
sloping
terrace
that
hosts
number
small
garden
plots
too
many
altogether
really
qualify
gardens
This
farm
Most
the
plots
are
planted
heavily
with
grains
and
vegetables
and
there
are
number
people
out
working
them
since
nice
day
and
one
knows
the
Guardians
are
busily
killing
everyone
the
admin
building
Nassun
walks
the
cobbled
path
above
the
terrace
briskly
with
her
head
down
that
she
can
concentrate
not
stumbling
since
she
can
sess
anything
after
whatever
Schaffa
did
the
six
ringed
woman
She
always
known
that
Guardians
can
shut
down
orogeny
but
never
felt
before
hard
walk
when
she
can
only
perceive
the
ground
with
her
eyes
and
feet
and
also
when
she
shaking
hard
Carefully
she
puts
one
foot
front
the
other
and
suddenly
someone
else
feet
are
just
there
and
Nassun
pulls
short
her
whole
body
going
rigid
with
shock
cWatch
where
you
going
the
girl
says
reflexively
She
thin
and
white
though
with
shock
slate
gray
ashblow
hair
and
she
maybe
Nassun
age
She
stops
though
when
she
gets
good
look
Nassun
cHey
there
something
your
face
looks
like
dead
bug
something
Gross
She
reaches
and
flicks
off
with
one
finger
Nassun
jerks
little
surprise
then
remembers
her
manners
cThanks
sorry
for
getting
your
way
cIt
all
right
The
girl
blinks
cThey
said
some
Guardians
had
come
and
brought
new
grit
Are
you
the
new
one
Nassun
stares
confusion
grit
The
other
girl
eyebrows
rise
cYeah
Trainee
Imperial
Orogene
She
carrying
bucket
gardening
supplies
which
doesn
fit
the
conversation
all
cThe
Guardians
used
bring
kids
here
before
the
Season
started
That
how
got
here
Technically
that
how
Nassun
got
here
too
cThe
Guardians
brought
she
echoes
She
hollow
inside
cMe
too
The
girl
sobers
then
looks
away
cDid
they
break
your
hand
yet
Nassun
breath
stops
her
throat
her
silence
the
girl
expression
turns
bitter
cYeah
They
every
grit
some
point
Hand
bones
fingers
She
shakes
her
head
then
takes
quick
gulping
breath
cWe
not
supposed
talk
about
But
not
you
whatever
they
say
not
your
fault
Another
quick
breath
see
you
around
Ajae
don
have
orogene
name
yet
What
your
name
Nassun
can
think
The
sound
Schaffa
fist
crushing
bone
echoes
her
head
cNassun
cNice
meet
you
Nassun
Ajae
nods
politely
then
moves
walking
down
the
steps
toward
terrace
She
hums
swinging
her
bucket
Nassun
stares
after
her
trying
understand
Orogene
name
Trying
not
understand
Did
they
break
your
hand
yet
This
place
This
Fulcrum
why
her
mother
broke
her
hand
Nassun
hand
twitches
phantom
pain
She
sees
again
the
rock
her
mother
hand
rising
Holding
moment
Falling
Are
you
sure
you
can
control
yourself
The
Fulcrum
why
her
mother
never
loved
her
why
her
father
does
not
love
her
anymore
why
her
brother
dead
Nassun
watches
Ajae
wave
thin
older
boy
who
busy
hoeing
This
place
These
people
who
have
right
exist
The
sapphire
isn
far
off
hovering
over
Jekity
where
has
been
for
the
two
weeks
since
she
and
Schaffa
and
Umber
left
travel
the
Antarctic
Fulcrum
She
can
sess
the
distance
though
too
far
off
see
seems
flicker
she
reaches
for
and
for
instant
she
marvels
that
she
knows
this
somehow
Instinctively
she
has
turned
face
Line
sight
She
doesn
need
eyes
orogeny
use
(This
orogene
nature
the
old
Schaffa
might
have
told
her
still
existed
Nassun
kind
innately
react
all
threats
the
same
way:
with
utterly
devastating
counterforce
would
have
told
her
this
before
breaking
her
hand
drive
home
the
lesson

There
are
many
silver
threads
this
place
The
orogenes
are
all
connected
through
practice
together
shared
experience
strong
DID
THEY
BREAK
YOUR
HAND
strong
over
the
three
breaths
Then
Nassun
lets
herself
fall
out
the
watery
blue
and
stands
there
shaking
its
wake
Some
while
later
Nassun
turns
and
sees
Schaffa
standing
front
her
with
Umber
cThey
weren
supposed
here
she
blurts
cYou
said
Schaffa
isn
smiling
and
still
way
that
Nassun
knows
well
cDid
you
this
help
then
Nassun
can
think
enough
lie
She
shakes
her
head
cThis
place
was
wrong
she
said
cThe
Fulcrum
wrong
cIs
test
but
Nassun
has
idea
how
pass
cWhy
you
say
that
cMama
was
wrong
The
Fulcrum
made
her
that
way
She
should
have
been
ally
you
like
she
thinks
reminds
cThis
place
made
her
something
else
She
cannot
articulate
cThis
place
made
her
wrong
Schaffa
looks
Umber
Umber
tilts
his
head
and
for
instant
there
flicker
the
silver
flicker
between
them
The
things
lodged
their
sessapinae
resonate
strange
way
But
then
Schaffa
frowns
and
she
sees
him
push
back
against
the
silver
hurts
him
this
but
does
anyway
turning
gaze
her
with
eyes
bright
and
jaw
tight
and
fresh
sweat
dotting
his
brow
think
you
may
right
little
one
all
says
cIt
follows:
Put
people
cage
and
they
will
devote
themselves
escaping
not
cooperating
with
those
who
caged
them
What
happened
here
was
inevitable
suppose
glances
Umber
cStill
Their
Guardians
must
have
been
very
lax
let
group
orogenes
get
the
drop
them
That
one
with
the
blowgun
born
feral
most
likely
and
taught
things
she
shouldn
have
been
before
being
brought
here
She
was
the
impetus
cLax
Guardians
says
Umber
watching
Schaffa
cYes
Schaffa
smiles
him
Nassun
frowns
confusion
cWe
destroyed
the
threat
Schaffa
says
cMost

Nassun

Connecting

her
more
that
suffers
gritting
his

and
pretending
that
this
another

even
she
sees
the

never

doing

and
will
not

she

cWe

shakes
her
head

cMe
specifically
Schaffa
opens
one
eye
then
frowns
little
don
remember
But
general
Guardians
are
made
other

and
given

for

cAnd
who
made
the
Guardian
before

and
the
one
before
that
Who
did
first
silent
for
time:
trying
remember
she
guesses
from
his
expression
That
something
very
wrong
with
Schaffa
chiseling
holes
his
memories
and
putting
fault
line
heavy
pressure
his
thoughts
something
Nassun
simply
accepts
what
But
she
needs
know

the
way
and
more

she
wants
know
how
make
him
better
don

says
finally
and
she
knows
done
with
the
conversation
the
way
exhales
and
shuts
his
eyes
again
cIn
the
end
the
why
does
not
matter
little
one
Why
are
you
orogene
Sometimes
must
simply
accept
our
lot
life
Nassun
decides
shut
then
and
few
moments
later
Schaffa

relaxes
into
sleep
for
the
first
time

She
keeps

from

from

probably

there
nothing

nearby
Nothing
except
Something
very
strange
Something
immense

are

bigger
than

rock
person
But
directly
underneath
the
white
not
stone
slab
Under
her
feet
practically
barely
more
than
ten
feet
down
noticing
her
attention
moves
This
feels
like
the
movement
the
world
Involuntarily
Nassun
gasps
and
leans
away
even
though
nothing
changes
but
the
gravity
around
her
and
that
only
little
The
immensity
whips
away
suddenly
senses
her
scrutiny
doesn
far
however
and
moment
later
the
immensity
moves
again:
Nassun
blinks
and
opens
her
eyes
see
statue
standing
the
edge
the
slab
which
was
not
there
before
Nassun
not
confused
Once
after
all
she
wanted
lorist
she
has
spent
hours
listening
tales
stone
eaters
and
the
mysteries
that
surround
their
existence
This
one
does
not
look
she
thought
would
the
lorist
tales
stone
eaters
have
marble
skin
and
jewel
hair
This
one
entirely
gray
even
the
cwhites
his
eyes
bare
chested
and
muscular
and
smiling
lips
drawn
back
from
teeth
that
are
clear
and
sharp
faceted
cYou
the
one
who
stoned
the
Fulcrum
few
days
ago
says
his
chest
Nassun
swallows
and
glances
Schaffa
heavy
sleeper
and
the
stone
eater
didn
speak
loudly
she
yells
Schaffa
will
probably
wake
but
what
can
Guardian
against
such
creature
She
isn
even
sure
she
can
anything
with
the
silver
the
stone
eater
blazing
morass
swirls
and
whirls
thread
all
tangled
inside
him
The
lore
however
clear
one
thing
about
stone
eaters:
They
not
attack
without
provocation
So:
yes
she
says
keeping
her
voice
low
cIs
that
problem
cNot
all
wanted
only
express
admiration
for
your
work
His
mouth
does
not
move
Why
smiling
much
Nassun
more
certain
with
every
passing
breath
that
the
expression
not
just
smile
cWhat
your
name
little
one
She
bristles
the
little
one
cWhy
The
stone
eater
steps
forward
moving
slowly
This
sounds
like
the
grind
millstone
and
looks
wrong
moving
statue
should
look
Nassun
flinches
revulsion
and
stills
cWhy
did
you
stone
them
cThey
were
wrong
The
stone
eater
steps
forward
again
onto
the
slab
Nassun
half
expects
the
slab
crack
tilt
beneath
the
creature
terrible
weight
which
she
knows
immense
mountain
compacted
into
the
size
and
shape
human
being
The
slab
deadciv
material
does
not
crack
however
and
now
the
creature
close
enough
for
her
see
the
fine
detailing
his
individual
hair
strands
You
were
wrong
says
his
strange
echoing
voice
cThe
people
the
Fulcrum
and
the
Guardians
are
not
blame
for
the
things
they
You
wanted
know
why
your
Guardian
must
suffer
does
The
answer
is:
doesn
have
Nassun
stiffens
Before
she
can
demand
know
more
the
stone
eater
head
turns
toward
him
There
flicker
something
adjustment
too
infinitely
fine
see
sess
and
and
suddenly
the
alive
vicious
throb
silver
within
Schaffa
dies
into
silence
Only
that
dark
needle
like
blot
his
sessapinae
remains
active
and
immediately
Nassun
sesses
its
effort
assert
control
For
the
moment
though
Schaffa
exhales
softly
and
relaxes
further
into
sleep
The
pain
that
has
been
grinding
him
for
days
gone
for
now
Nassun
gasps
softly
Schaffa
has
the
chance
truly
rest
last
she
will
not
destroy
Instead
she
says
the
stone
eater
cHow
did
you
that
can
teach
you
can
teach
you
how
fight
his
tormentor
his
master
too
you
wish
Nassun
swallows
hard
yeah
wish
She
isn
stupid
though
cIn
exchange
for
what
cNothing
you
fight
his
master
then
you
fight
enemy
too
will
make
allies
She
knows
now
that
the
stone
eater
has
been
lurking
nearby
listening
her
but
she
doesn
care
anymore
save
Schaffa
She
licks
her
lips
which
taste
faintly
sulfur
The
ash
haze
has
been
getting
thicker
recent
weeks
cOkay
she
says
cWhat
your
name
been
listening
knows
who
she
This
gesture
toward
alliance
cNassun
And
you
have
name
many
Call
what
you
wish
needs
name
Alliances
don
work
without
names
they
Steel
the
first
thing
that
pops
into
her
mind
Because
gray
cSteel
The
sense
that
does
not
care
lingers
will
come
you
later
Steel
says
cWhen
can
speak
uninterrupted
instant
later
gone
into
the
earth
and
the
mountain
vanishes
from
her
awareness
seconds
moment
later
Umber
emerges
from
the
forest
around
the
deadciv
slab
and
begins
walking
the
hill
toward
her
She
actually
glad
see
him
even
though
his
gaze
sharpens
draws
nearer
and
sees
that
Schaffa
asleep
stops
three
paces
away
more
than
close
enough
for
Guardian
speed
kill
you
you
try
anything
Nassun
says
nodding
solemnly
cYou
know
that
right
you
wake
him
Umber
smiles
know
you
try
try
and
actually
sighs
and
there
great
compassion
his
voice
cYou
don
even
know
how
dangerous
you
are
far
far
more
than
She
doesn
and
that
bothers
her
lot
Umber
does
not
act
out
cruelty
sees
her
threat
there
must
some
reason
for
But
doesn
matter
cSchaffa
wants
alive
she
says
cSo
live
Even
have
kill
you
Umber
appears
consider
this
She
glimpses
the
quick
flicker
the
silver
within
him
and
knows
suddenly
and
instinctively
that
she
longer
talking
Umber
exactly
His
master
Umber
says
cAnd
Schaffa
decides
you
should
die
cThen
die
That
what
the
Fulcrum
got
wrong
she
feels
certain
They
treated
the
Guardians
enemies
and
maybe
they
once
were
like
Schaffa
said
But
allies
must
trust
one
another
vulnerable
one
another
Schaffa
the
only
person
the
world
who
loves
Nassun
and
Nassun
will
die
kill
remake
the
world
for
his
sake
Slowly
Umber
inclines
his
head
cThen
will
trust
your
love
for
him
says
For
instant
there
echo
his
voice
his
body
through
the
ground
reverberating
away
deep
cFor
now
With
that
moves
past
her
and
sits
down
near
Schaffa
assuming
guard
stance
himself
Nassun
does
not
understand
Guardian
reasoning
but
she
learned
one
thing
about
them
over
the
months:
They
not
bother
lie
Umber
says
will
trust
Schaffa
Trust
Nassun
love
for
Schaffa
because
there
difference
But
Umber
says
this
has
meaning
him
then
she
can
rely
that
she
lies
down
her
own
bedroll
and
relaxes
spite
everything
She
doesn
sleep
for
some
while
though
Nerves
maybe
Night
falls
The
evening
clear
apart
from
the
faint
haze
ash
blowing
from
the
north
and
few
broken
pearled
clouds
that
periodically
drift
southward
along
the
breeze
The
stars
come
out
winking
through
the
haze
and
Nassun
stares
them
for
long
while
She
begun
drift
her
mind
finally
relaxing
toward
sleep
when
belatedly
she
