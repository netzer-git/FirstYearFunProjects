There
thing
you
will
not
see
happening
yet
that
going
impact
the
rest
your
life
Imagine
Imagine
You
know
what
you
think
both
with
your
thinking
mind
and
the
animal
instinctive
part
you
You
see
stone
body
clothed
flesh
and
even
though
you
never
really
believed
was
human
you
did
think
child
You
still
think
though
Alabaster
has
told
you
the
truth
that
haven
been
child
since
before
your
language
existed
Perhaps
was
special
never
special
child
Hearing
this
and
believing
are
two
different
things
however
special
You
should
imagine
what
truly
among
kind
then:
old
and
powerful
and
greatly
feared
legend
monster
special
You
should
imagine

Castrima
egg
Motes
surround
this
egg
lurking
the
stone
Eggs
are
rich
prize
for
scavengers
and
easy
devour
left
unguarded
This
one
being
devoured
though
the
people
Castrima
are
barely
aware
the
act
(Ykka
alone
think
and
even
she
only
suspects
Such

notice

very
slow

nevertheless
once
the
devouring
done
special
Yet
something
has
made
the
scavengers
pause
teeth
bared
but
not
sinking
There
another
old
and
powerful
one
here:
the
one
you
call
Antimony
She
isn
interested
guarding
the
egg
but
she
could

She
will

Then
take
the
two
who
have
been
stalking
Alabaster
hoping
dart
should
Antimony
become
distracted
this
not
because
Antimony
needs
the
help
mind
but
simply
because
our
race
cannot
bear
that
level
stupidity
