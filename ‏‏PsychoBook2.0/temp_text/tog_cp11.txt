stirs

murmuring
softly
Automatically
Schaffa
reaches
out

and
she
quiets
once
There

ache

chest
that
perhaps
might
love
remembers
loving
Leshet
and
Damaya
and
others
and
yet
did
such
things

Nassun
stirs
little
and
half
wakes

and
twitches
with
the
memory
that
too
Then
the
feeling
changes
and
his
resolve
refocuses
What
happened
before
does
not
matter
That
was
different
Schaffa
has
another
chance
now
And
being
less
than
himself
means
being
less
than
the
monster
that
was

regret

disagrees
with

back

and
then
stops
himself
She
more

than
just

from
pain
Use

voice

her

like
her
mother
Train
this

Schaffa
thinks
back
and
braces
himself
bear
the
lash
retaliation
only
pain
Schaffa
tucks
Nassun
and
kisses
her
forehead
and
puts
out
the
light
leaves
heads
for
the
ridge
that
overlooks
the
town
and
stands
there
for
the
rest
the
night
grinding
his
teeth
and
trying
forget
the
last
who
was
and
promising
himself
better
future
Eventually
the
other
two
Guardians
come
out
onto
the
steps
their
cabin
well
but
ignores
the
alien
pressure
their
gazes
against
his
back
