You
stare
the
stone
eater
that
has
burst
forth
from
the
chalcedony
chrysalis
stands
hunched
and
perfectly
still
watching
you
sidelong
through
the
slight
heat
waver
the
air
around
the
split
geode
Its
hair
you
remember
from
that
half
real
half
dream
moment
within
the
garnet
obelisk:
frozen
splash
what
happens
ashblow
hair
when
hard
gust
wind
lifts
and
back
Translucent
white
ish
opal
now
instead
simply
white
But
unlike
the
fleshly
form
that
you
grew
know
this
stone
eater
cskin
black
the
night
sky
once
was
before
the
Season
What
you
thought
were
cracks
back
then
you
now
realize
are
actually
white
and
silver
marbling
veins
Even
the
elegant
drape
pseudo
clothing
wrapped
around
the
body
simple
chiton
that
hangs
off
one
shoulder
marbled
black
Only
the
eyes
lack
the
marbling
the
whites
now
matte
smooth
darkness
The
irises
are
still
icewhite
They
stand
out
from
the
black
face
stark
and
atavistically
disturbing
that
actually
takes
you
moment
realize
the
face
around
still
Hoa
Hoa
older
you
see
once
the
face
that
young
man
and
not
boy
Still
too
wide
with
too
narrow
mouth
racially
nonsensical
You
can
read
anxiety
those
frozen
features
though
because
you
learned
read
face
that
was
once
softer
and
designed
elicit
your
compassion
cWhich
was
the
lie
you
ask
the
only
thing
you
can
think
ask
cThe
lie
The
voice
man
now
The
same
voice
but
the
tenor
range
Coming
from
his
chest
somewhere
You
step
into
the
room
still
unpleasantly
hot
though
cooling
off
quickly
You
sweating
anyway
cYour
human
shape
this
cBoth
have
been
true
different
times
cAh
yes
Alabaster
said
all
you
were
human
Once
anyway
There
moment
silence
cAre
you
human
this
you
cannot
help
but
laugh
once
cOfficially
cNever
mind
what
others
think
What
you
feel
yourself
cHuman
cThen
stands
steaming
between
the
halves
giant
rock
from
which
just
hatched
cUh
not
anymore
cShould
take
your
word
for
that
listen
what
feel
myself
You
shake
your
head
walking
far
you
can
around
the
geode
Inside
there
nothing
thin
stone
shell
bare
crystals
the
usual
precipitant
lining
Probably
doesn
qualify
geode
then
cHow
you
end
obelisk
cPissed
off
the
wrong
rogga
This
surprises
you
into
laugh
which
makes
you
stop
and
stare
him
uncomfortable
laugh
watching
you
the
way
always
used
all
eyes
and
hope
Should
really
matter
that
the
eyes
are
strange
now
didn
know
that
could
done
you
say
cTrapping
stone
eater
mean
cYou
could
one
the
only
ways
stop
one
cNot
kill
you
obviously
cNo
There
only
one
way
that
cWhich
flicks
face
you
This
seems
instantaneous
suddenly
the
statue
pose
completely
different
serene
and
upright
with
one
hand
raised
invitation
Appeal
cAre
you
planning
kill
Essun
You
sigh
and
shake
your
head
and
extend
hand
touch
one
the
stone
halves
out
curiosity
cDon
still
too
hot
for
your
flesh
pauses
cThis
how
get
clean
without
soap
day
along
the
side
the
road
south
Tirimo
boy
who
stared
bar
soap
confusion
then
delight
still
him
You
can
shake
off
you
sigh
and
also
let
the
part
yourself
that
wants
treat
him
something
else
something
frightening
something
other
Hoa
wants
eat
you
and
tried
help
you
find
your
daughter
even
though
failed
There
intimacy
these
facts
however
strange
they
are
that
means
something
you
You
fold
your
arms
and
pace
slowly
around
the
geode
and
him
His
eyes
follow
cSo
who
kicked
your
ass
has
regenerated
the
eyes
that
were
missing
and
the
lower
jaw
The
limbs
that
had
been
torn
off
are
part
him
again
There
still
blood
the
living
room
but
whatever
there
had
been
your
bedroom
now
gone
along
with
layer
the
floor
and
walls
Stone
eaters
are
said
have
control
over
the
very
smallest
particles
matter
Simple
enough
reappropriate
one
own
detached
substance
repurpose
unused
surplus
material
You
guess
dozen
kind
Then
one
particular
cThat
many
cThey
were
children
How
many
children
would
take
overwhelm
you
You
were
child
looked
like
child
His
voice
softens
only
did
that
for
you
There
greater
difference
between
this
Hoa
and
that
Hoa
than
their
states
being
When
adult
Hoa
says
things
like
this
the
words
have
entirely
different
texture
from
when
child
Hoa
said
them
You
not
certain
you
like
that
texture
cSo
you
been
off
getting
into
fights
all
this
time
you
say
adjusting
the
subject
back
toward
comfort
cThere
was
stone
eater
the
Flat
Top
gray
cYes
You
didn
think
was
possible
for
stone
eater
look
disgruntled
but
Hoa
does
cThat
one
isn
child
was
the
one
who
defeated
finally
though
managed
escape
without
too
much
damage
You
marvel
for
moment
that
thinks
having
all
his
limbs
and
jaw
torn
off
not
much
damage
But
you
little
glad
too
The
gray
stone
eater
hurt
Hoa
and
you
hurt
him
back
Ephemeral
revenge
maybe
but
makes
you
feel
like
you
look
out
for
your
own
Hoa
still
sounds
defensive
cIt
was
also
unwise
for
face
him
while
clothed
human
flesh
too
damned
hot
the
room
Mopping
sweat
from
your
face
you
move
into
the
living
room
push
aside
and
tie
off
the
main
door
curtain
cooler
air
will
circulate
more
easily
and
sit
down
the
table
the
time
you
turn
back
Hoa
the
door
your
bedroom
framed
beautifully
the
arch
it:
study
youth
wary
contemplation
cIs
that
why
you
changed
back
face
him
You
didn
see
the
bit
rag
that
contained
his
rocks
while
you
were
the
bedroom
Maybe
caught
fire
and
just
charred
cloth
amid
the
rest
purpose
served
changed
back
because
was
time
There
that
tone
resignation
again
sounded
that
way
when
you
first
realized
what
was
Like
knows
lost
something
your
eyes
and
can
get
back
and
has
choice
but
accept
that
but
doesn
have
like
could
have
kept
that
shape
only
for
limited
time
made
choice
decrease
the
time
and
increase
the
chance
you
will
survive
cOh
Beyond
him
your
room
you
suddenly
notice
that
the
leftover
shell
his
egg
melting
Sort
dissolving
and
lightening
color
and
merging
back
into
the
clear
material
the
crystal
parting
around
the
detritus
your
belongings
rejoins
its
former
substance
and
solidifies
again
You
stare
that
instead
him
for
moment
fascinated
Until
says
cThey
want
you
dead
Essun
cThey
You
blink
cWho
cSome
kind
Some
merely
want
use
you
won
let
them
You
frown
cWhich
You
won
let
them
kill
you
won
let
them
use
Either
The
echoing
voice
grows
sharp
suddenly
You
remember
him
crouching
baring
his
teeth
like
some
feral
beast
occurs
you
with
the
suddenness
epiphany
that
you
haven
seen
many
stone
eaters
around
lately
Ruby
Hair
Butter
Marble
Ugly
Dress
Toothshine
all
the
regulars
not
glimpse
months
Ykka
even
remarked
the
sudden
absence
chers
cYou
ate
her
you
blurt
There
pause
eaten
many
Hoa
says
inflectionless
You
remember
him
giggling
and
calling
you
weird
Curling
against
you
sleep
Earthfires
you
can
deal
with
this
cWhy
Hoa
You
spread
your
hands
They
are
ordinary
middle
aged
woman
hands
bit
dry
You
helped
with
the
leather
tanning
crew
few
days
ago
and
the
solution
made
your
skin
crack
and
peel
You
been
rubbing
them
with
some
the
nuts
you
got
the
previous
week
comm
share
even
though
fat
precious
and
you
should
eating
rather
than
using
for
your
vanity
your
right
palm
there
small
white
thumbnail
shaped
crescent
cold
days
that
hand
bones
ache
Ordinary
woman
hands
cThere
nothing
special
about
you
say
cThere
must
other
orogenes
with
the
potential
access
the
obelisks
Earthfires
Nassun
cWhy
are
you
here
You
mean
why
has
attached
himself
you
silent
for
moment
Then:
cYou
asked
was
all
right
This
makes
sense
for
moment
and
then
does
Allia
beautiful
sunny
day
looming
disaster
you
hovered
agony
amid
the
cracked
dissonant
core
the
garnet
obelisk
you
saw
him
for
the
first
time
How
long
had
been
that
thing
Long
enough
for
buried
beneath
Seasons
worth
sediment
and
coral
growth
Long
enough
forgotten
like
all
the
dead
civilizations
the
world
And
then
you
came
along
and
asked
how
was
doing
Evil
Earth
you
thought
you
hallucinated
that
You
take
deep
breath
and
get
going
the
entrance
the
apartment
The
comm
quiet
far
you
can
tell
Some
people
are
going
about
their
usual
business
but
there
are
fewer
them
around
than
usual
The
ones
following
routine
are
proof
peace
people
went
about
their
business
Tirimo
too
right
before
they
tried
kill
you
Tonkee
didn
come
home
again
last
night
but
this
time
you
not
sure
that
she
with
Hjarka
the
green
room
There
catalyst
alive
Castrima
now
accelerating
unseen
chemical
reactions
facilitating
unexpected
outcomes
Join
and
live
the
gray
one
had
told
them
but
not
with
your
roggas
Will
the
people
Castrima
stop
think
that
Equatorial
comm
really
wants
sudden
influx
mongrel
Midlatters
and
best
will
make
slaves
meat
them
Your
mothering
instinct
alive
with
warning
Look
after
your
own
whispers
the
back
your
mind
Gather
them
close
and
guard
them
well
You
know
what
happens
when
you
turn
your
back
for
even
minute
You
shoulder
the
runny
sack
that
still
your
hand
Keeping
with
you
isn
even
question
this
point
Then
you
turn
Hoa
cCome
with
Hoa
suddenly
smiling
again
don
walk
anymore
Essun
Right
going
Ykka
then
Meet
there
does
not
nod
simply
vanishes
wasted
movement
you
get
used
People
don
look
you
you
cross
the
bridges
and
walkways
the
comm
The
center
your
back
itches
from
their
stares
you
pass
You
cannot
help
thinking
Tirimo
again
Ykka
not
her
apartment
You
look
around
follow
the
patterns
movement
the
comm
with
your
eyes
and
finally
head
toward
the
Flat
Top
She
cannot
still
there
You
gone
home
watched
child
turn
into
stone
eater
slept
several
hours
She
can
She
You
see
that
only
few
people
are
still
the
Flat
Top
now
gaggle
maybe
twenty
sitting
pacing
looking
angry
and
exasperated
and
troubled
For
the
twenty
you
see
there
are
surely
another
hundred
gathering
apartments
and
the
baths
and
the
storage
rooms
having
the
same
conversation
hushed
tones
with
small
groups
But
Ykka
here
sitting
one
the
divans
that
someone
has
brought
from
her
apartment
still
talking
She
hoarse
you
realize
you
draw
close
Visibly
exhausted
But
still
talking
Something
about
supply
lines
from
one
the
southern
allied
comms
which
she
directing
man
who
walking
circles
with
his
arms
folded
scoffing
everything
she
says
fear
not
listening
Ykka
trying
reason
with
him
anyway
ridiculous
Look
after
your
own
You
step
around
people
some
whom
flinch
away
from
you
and
stop
beside
her
need
talk
you
private
Ykka
stops
midsentence
and
blinks
you
Her
eyes
are
red
and
sticky
dry
She
hasn
had
any
water
for
while
cWhat
about
cIt
important
sop
courtesy
you
nod
the
people
sitting
around
her
cSorry
She
sighs
and
rubs
her
eyes
which
just
makes
them
redder
cFine
She
gets
then
pauses
face
the
remaining
people
cVote
tomorrow
morning
haven
convinced
you
well
You
know
what
then
They
watch
silence
you
lead
her
away
Back
her
apartment
you
pull
the
front
curtain
shut
and
open
the
one
that
leads
into
her
private
rooms
Not
much
this
space
indicate
her
status:
She
got
two
pallets
and
lot
pillows
but
her
clothes
are
just
basket
and
the
books
and
scrolls
one
side
the
room
are
just
stacked
the
floor
bookcases
dresser
The
food
from
her
comm
share
stacked
haphazardly
against
one
wall
beside
familiar
gourd
that
the
Castrimans
tend
use
for
storing
drinking
water
You
snag
the
gourd
with
your
elbow
and
pick
from
the
food
pile
dried
orange
stick
dry
bean
curd
that
Ykka
been
soaking
with
some
mushrooms
shallow
pan
and
small
slab
salt
fish
not
exactly
meal
but
nutrition
cOn
the
bed
you
say
gesturing
with
your
chin
and
bringing
the
food
her
You
hand
her
the
gourd
first
Ykka
who
has
observed
all
this
increasing
irritation
snaps
cYou
not
type
this
why
you
dragged
here
cNot
exactly
But
while
you
here
you
need
rest
She
looks
mutinous
cYou
can
convince
anyone
anything
Let
alone
people
whose
hate
can
reasoned
with
you
too
exhausted
think
straight
She
grumbles
but
measure
how
tired
she
that
she
actually
goes
the
bed
and
sits
down
its
edge
You
nod
the
gourd
and
she
dutifully
drinks
three
quick
swallows
and
down
for
now
the
lorists
advise
after
dehydration
stink
need
bath
cShould
thought
that
before
you
decided
try
talk
down
brewing
lynch
mob
You
take
the
gourd
and
push
the
dish
food
into
her
hand
She
sighs
and
starts
grimly
chewing
cThey
not
going
She
doesn
get
far
into
that
lie
though
before
she
flinches
and
stares
something
beyond
you
You
know
before
you
turn:
Hoa
cOkay
not
rusting
room
told
him
meet
here
you
say
cIt
Hoa
cYou
told
Ykka
swallows
hard
stares
moment
longer
then
finally
resumes
eating
the
orange
She
chews
slowly
her
gaze
never
leaving
Hoa
cGot
tired
playing
the
human
then
Not
sure
why
you
bothered
you
were
too
weird
pass
You
over
the
wall
near
the
bedroom
door
and
sit
down
against
the
floor
The
runny
sack
has
come
off
for
this
but
you
make
sure
keep
near
hand
Ykka
you
say
cYou
talked
the
other
members
your
council
and
half
your
comm
still
and
rogga
and
native
and
newcomer
The
perspective
you
missing
theirs
You
nod
Hoa
Ykka
blinks
then
eyes
Hoa
with
new
interest
did
ask
you
sit
council
once
can
speak
for
kind
any
more
than
you
can
for
yours
Hoa
says
cAnd
had
more
important
things
You
see
Ykka
blink
his
voice
and
blatantly
stare
him
You
wave
hand
Hoa
wearily
Unlike
Ykka
you
slept
but
wasn
exactly
quality
sleep
while
you
sat
sweltering
apartment
waiting
for
geode
hatch
cSpeaking
what
you
know
will
help
And
then
prompted
some
instinct
you
add
cPlease
Because
somehow
you
think
reticent
His
expression
hasn
changed
His
posture
the
one
showed
you
last
the
young
man
repose
with
one
hand
upraised
changed
his
location
but
not
his
position
Still
The
proof
his
reticence
comes
when
says
cVery
well
all
the
tone
But
fine
you
can
work
with
reticent
cWhat
does
the
gray
stone
eater
want
Because
you
pretty
rusting
sure
doesn
really
want
Castrima
join
some
Equatorial
comm
Human
nation
state
politics
just
wouldn
mean
much
them
unless
was
service
some
other
goal
The
people
Rennanis
are
his
pawns
not
the
other
way
around
cThere
are
many
now
Hoa
replies
cEnough
called
people
ourselves
and
not
merely
mistake
this
apparent
non
sequitur
you
exchange
look
with
Ykka
who
looks
back
you
say
your
mess
not
mine
Maybe
relevant
somehow
cYes
you
prompt
cThere
are
those
kind
who
believe
this
world
can
safely
bear
only
one
people
Evil
Earth
This
what
Alabaster
talked
about
How
had
described
Factions
ancient
war
The
ones
who
wanted
people
neutralized
Like
the
stone
eaters
themselves
Baster
had
said
cYou
want
wipe
out
you
say
Whisper
cOr
change
into
stone
Like
what
happening
Alabaster
cNot
all
Hoa
says
softly
cAnd
not
all
you
world
only
stone
people
The
thought
makes
you
shiver
You
envision
falling
ash
and
skeletal
trees
and
creepy
statues
everywhere
some
the
latter
moving
How
They
are
unstoppable
but
until
now
they
only
preyed
each
other
(That
you
know
Can
they
turn
all
you
into
stone
like
Alabaster
And
they
wanted
wipe
humankind
out
shouldn
they
have
been
able
manage
before
now
You
shake
your
head
cThis
world
has
borne
two
people
for
Seasons
Three
you
count
orogenes
the
stills
cNot
all
are
content
with
that
His
voice
very
soft
now
cSuch
rare
thing
the
birth
new
one
our
kind
wear
endlessly
while
you
rise
and
spawn
and
wilt
like
mushrooms
hard
not
envy
covet
Ykka
shaking
her
head
confusion
Though
her
voice
holds
its
usual
unflappable
attitude
you
see
little
frown
wonder
between
her
brows
Her
mouth
pulls
one
side
though
she
cannot
help
but
show
least
little
disgust
cFine
she
says
cSo
stone
eaters
used
and
now
you
want
kill
Why
should
trust
you
cNot
stone
eaters
Not
all
want
the
same
thing
Some
like
things
they
are
Some
even
want
make
the
world
better
though
not
all
agree
what
that
means
Instantly
his
posture
changes
hands
out
palms
shoulders
lifted
What
can
you
gesture
cWe
people
cAnd
what
you
want
you
ask
Because
didn
answer
Ykka
question
and
you
noticed
Those
silver
irises
flick
over
you
stay
You
think
you
see
wistfulness
his
still
face
cThe
same
thing
always
wanted
Essun
help
you
Only
that
You
think
Not
everyone
agrees
what
chelp
means
cWell
this
touching
Ykka
says
She
rubs
her
tired
eyes
cBut
you
not
getting
the
point
What
does
Castrima
being
destroyed
have
with
giving
the
world
one
people
What
this
gray
man
don
know
Hoa
still
looking
you
not
unnerving
should
tried
ask
him
didn
well
cGuess
you
say
Because
you
know
full
well
there
reason
asked
the
gray
man
the
first
place
Hoa
eyes
shift
down
Your
distrust
hurts
cHe
wants
make
sure
the
Obelisk
Gate
never
opened
again
cThe
what
Ykka
asks
But
you
leaning
your
head
back
against
the
wall
floored
and
horrified
and
wondering
course
Alabaster
What
easier
way
wipe
out
people
who
depend
food
and
sunlight
survive
than
simply
let
this
Season
wear
until
they
are
extinct
Leaving
nothing
but
the
stone
eaters
inherit
the
darkening
Earth
And
make
sure
happens
kill
the
only
person
with
the
power
end
Only
person
besides
you
you
realize
with
chill
But
You
can
manipulate
obelisk
but
you
haven
got
clue
how
activate
two
hundred
the
rusting
things
once
And
can
Alabaster
anymore
Every
use
orogeny
kills
him
slowly
Flaking
rust
you
the
only
one
left
who
even
has
the
potential
open
the
Gate
But
Gray
Man
pet
army
kills
both
you
his
purpose
served
either
way
cIt
means
Gray
Man
wants
wipe
out
orogenes
particular
you
say
Ykka
You
abbreviating
heavily
not
lying
That
what
you
tell
yourself
That
what
you
need
tell
Ykka
that
she
never
learns
that
orogenes
have
the
potential
power
save
the
world
and
that
she
never
attempts
access
obelisk
herself
This
what
Alabaster
must
have
constantly
had
with
you
telling
you
some
the
truth
because
you
deserve
but
not
enough
that
you
skewer
yourself
Then
you
think
another
bone
you
can
throw
cHoa
was
trapped
obelisk
for
while
said
the
only
thing
that
can
stop
them
Not
the
only
way
said
But
maybe
Hoa
giving
you
only
the
safe
truths
too
cWell
shit
Ykka
says
annoyed
cYou
can
obelisk
stuff
Throw
one
him
You
groan
cThat
wouldn
work
cWhat
would
then
have
idea
That
what
been
trying
learn
from
Alabaster
all
this
time
And
failing
you
don
want
say
Ykka
can
guess
anyway
cGreat
Ykka
abruptly
seems
wilt
cYou
right
need
sleep
had
Esni
mobilize
the
Strongbacks
secure
weapons
the
comm
Ostensibly
they
making
them
ready
for
use
have
fight
off
these
Equatorials
truth
She
shrugs
sighs
and
you
understand
People
are
frightened
right
now
Best
not
tempt
fate
cYou
can
trust
the
Strongbacks
you
say
softly
Ykka
looks
you
cCastrima
isn
wherever
you
came
from
You
want
smile
though
you
don
because
you
know
how
ugly
the
smile
will
You
from
many
places
every
one
them
you
learned
that
roggas
and
stills
can
never
live
together
Ykka
shifts
little
the
look
your
face
anyway
She
tries
again:
cLook
how
many
other
comms
would
let
live
after
learning
what
was
You
shake
your
head
cYou
were
useful
That
worked
for
the
Imperial
Orogenes
too
But
being
useful
others
not
the
same
thing
being
equal
cFine
then
useful
all
are
Kill
exile
the
roggas
and
lose
Castrima
under
Then
the
mercy
bunch
people
who
would
soon
treat
all
like
roggas
just
because
our
ancestors
couldn
pick
race
and
stick
cYou
keep
saying
you
say
gentle
bothers
you
puncture
her
illusions
She
stops
and
muscle
her
jaw
flexes
once
twice
cStills
learned
hate
They
can
learn
differently
cNow
With
enemy
literally
the
gate
You
tired
tired
all
this
shit
cNow
when
see
the
worst
them
Ykka
watches
you
for
long
moment
Then
she
slumps
completely
her
back
bowing
and
her
head
hanging
and
her
ashblow
hair
sliding
off
the
sides
her
neck
until
looks
utterly
ridiculous
butterfly
mane
hides
her
face
But
she
draws
long
weary
breath
and
sounds
almost
like
sob
laugh
cNo
Essun
She
rubs
her
face
cJust
Castrima
home
same
theirs
worked
for
Fought
for
Castrima
wouldn
here
not
for
and
probably
some
the
other
roggas
who
risked
themselves
keep
all
going
over
the
years
not
giving
cIt
isn
giving
look
out
for
yourself
Yes
She
lifts
her
head
wasn
sob
laugh
She
furious
Just
not
you
cYou
saying
these
people
parents
creche
teachers
friends
lovers
You
saying
just
leave
them
their
fate
You
saying
they
nothing
That
they
not
people
all
just
beasts
whose
nature
kill
You
saying
roggas
are
nothing
but
but
prey
and
that
all
ever
won
accept
that
She
sounds
determined
makes
your
heart
ache
because
you
felt
the
same
way
she
did
once
would
nice
still
feel
that
way
have
some
hope
real
future
real
community
real
life
but
you
have
lost
three
children
relying
stills
better
nature
You
grab
the
runny
sack
and
get
leave
rubbing
hand
over
your
locs
Hoa
vanishes
reading
your
cue
that
the
conversation
over
Later
then
When
you
almost
the
curtain
though
Ykka
stops
you
with
what
she
says
cPass
the
word
around
she
tells
you
The
emotion
gone
from
her
voice
cNo
matter
what
happens
can
start
anything
Loaded
into
that
delicate
emphasis
acknowledgment
that
orogenes
are
the
she
means
this
time
cWe
shouldn
even
finish
Fighting
back
could
set
off
mob
Only
talk
the
others
small
groups
Person
person
best
you
can
one
thinks
getting
together
conspire
Make
sure
the
children
know
all
this
Make
sure
none
them
are
ever
alone
Most
the
orogene
children
know
how
defend
themselves
The
techniques
you
taught
them
work
just
well
for
deterring
stopping
attackers
for
icing
boilbug
nests
But
Ykka
right:
There
are
too
few
you
fight
back
not
without
destroying
Castrima
pyrrhic
victory
means
that
some
orogenes
are
going
die
You
going
let
them
die
even
you
could
save
them
And
you
did
not
think
Ykka
cold
enough
think
this
way
Your
surprise
must
show
your
face
Ykka
smiles
have
hope
she
says
cbut
not
stupid
you
right
and
things
get
hopeless
then
don
without
fight
make
them
regret
turning
But
that
point
return
hope
you
not
right
You
know
you
right
The
belief
that
orogenes
will
never
anything
but
the
world
meat
dances
amid
the
cells
you
like
magic
isn
fair
You
just
want
your
life
matter
But
you
say:
hope
not
right
too
