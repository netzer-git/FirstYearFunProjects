SQUINTING
you
through
curtain
hair
You
just
come
into
the
apartment
after
spending
part
the
day
helping
one
the
work
shifts
fletch
and
repair
crossbow
bolts
for
the
Hunters
use
Since
you
not
part
any
particular
use
caste
you
been
helping
out
with
each
them
turn
little
every
day
This
was
Ykka
advice
though
Ykka
skeptical
about
your
newfound
determination
try
fit
into
the
comm
She
likes
that
you
trying
least
Another
suggestion
was
for
you
encourage
Tonkee
the
same
since
thus
far
Tonkee
done
nothing
but
eat
and
sleep
and
bathe
the
comm
generosity
Granted
certain
amount
the
lattermost
has
been
necessary
for
the
sake
comm
socialization
the
moment
Tonkee
kneeling
over
basin
water
her
room
hacking
her
hair
with
knife
chop
out
the
matted
bits
You
keeping
well
back
because
the
room
smells
mildew
and
body
odor
and
because
you
think
you
see
something
moving
the
water
along
with
her
shed
hair
Tonkee
may
have
needed
wear
filth
part
her
commless
disguise
but
that
doesn
mean
wasn
actual
filth
moon
you
say
strange
word
brief
and
round
you
not
sure
how
much
stretch
out
the
sound
the
middle
What
else
had
Alabaster
said
satellite
said
geomest
would
know
She
frowns
more
while
sawing
particularly
stubborn
hank
cWell
don
know
what
talking
about
Never
heard
moon
The
obelisks
are
area
expertise
remember
Then
she
blinks
and
pauses
letting
the
half
hacked
hank
dangle
cAlthough
technically
the
obelisks
themselves
are
satellites
cWhat
cWell
satellite
just
means
object
whose
motion
and
position
are
dependent
another
The
object
that
controls
everything
called
primary
the
dependent
object
its
satellite
See
She
shrugs
cIt
something
astronomests
talk
about
when
you
can
get
any
sense
out
them
Orbital
mechanics
She
rolls
her
eyes
cWhat
cGibberish
Plate
tectonics
for
the
sky
You
stare
disbelieving
and
she
waves
hand
cAnyway
told
you
how
the
obelisks
followed
you
Tirimo
Where
you
they
That
makes
them
satellites
your
primary
You
shudder
not
liking
the
thought
that
comes
into
your
head
thin
invisible
tethers
anchoring
you
the
amethyst
the
nearer
topaz
and
now
the
distant
onyx
whose
dark
presence
growing
your
mind
And
oddly
you
also
think
the
Fulcrum
the
tethers
that
bound
you
even
when
you
had
the
apparent
freedom
leave
and
travel
You
always
came
back
though
the
Fulcrum
would
come
after
you
the
form
the
Guardians
cChains
you
say
softly
cNo
Tonkee
says
distractedly
She
working
the
hank
again
and
having
real
trouble
with
Her
knife
has
gone
blunt
You
leave
for
moment
and
into
the
room
that
you
share
with
Hoa
fetching
the
whetstone
from
your
pack
She
blinks
when
you
offer
her
then
nods
thanks
and
starts
sharpening
the
knife
cIf
there
was
chain
between
you
and
obelisk
would
following
you
because
you
making
follow
you
Force
not
gravity
mean
you
could
make
obelisk
what
you
wanted
You
let
out
little
breath
amusement
this
cBut
satellite
reacts
you
regardless
whether
you
try
make
react
drawn
your
presence
and
the
weight
you
exert
upon
the
universe
lingers
around
you
because
can
help
itself
She
waves
wet
hand
distractedly
while
you
stare
again
cNot
ascribe
motivations
and
intentions
the
obelisks
course
that
would
silly
You
crouch
against
the
far
wall
the
room
consider
this
while
she
resumes
work
the
remainder
her
hair
begins
loosen
you
recognize
last
because
curly
and
dark
like
your
own
instead
ashblow
and
gray
little
looser
the
curl
maybe
Midlatter
hair
another
mark
against
her
the
eyes
her
family
probably
And
given
the
bog
standard
Sanzed
look
her
otherwise
she
bit
the
short
and
pear
shaped
side
but
that
what
comes
the
Yumenescene
families
not
using
Breeders
improve
themselves
something
you
would
remembered
about
her
from
that
long
ago
visit
she
made
the
Fulcrum
You
don
think
Alabaster
was
talking
about
the
obelisks
when
mentioned
this
moon
thing
Still
cYou
said
that
thing
found
the
Fulcrum
that
socket
was
where
they
built
the
obelisks
immediately
clear
you
back
ground
that
Tonkee
actually
interested
She
sets
the
knife
down
and
leans
forward
her
face
excited
through
the
dangling
uneven
remainder
her
hair
cMmm
hmm
Maybe
not
all
them
The
dimensions
every
obelisk
recorded
have
been
slightly
different
only
some
maybe
even
just
one
would
have
fit
that
socket
maybe
the
socket
changed
every
time
they
put
one
there
adapting
itself
the
obelisk
cHow
you
know
they
put
them
there
Maybe
they
first
grew
there
then
were
faceted
mined
and
taken
away
later
This
makes
Tonkee
look
thoughtful
you
feel
obliquely
proud
have
considered
something
she
hasn
cAnd
they
who
She
blinks
then
sits
back
her
excitement
visibly
fading
Finally
she
says
cSupposedly
the
Yumenescene
Leadership
descended
from
the
people
who
saved
the
world
after
the
Shattering
Season
have
texts
passed
down
from
that
time
secrets
that
each
family
charged
with
keeping
and
which
supposed
shown
upon
earning
our
use
and
comm
names
She
scowls
cMy
family
didn
because
they
were
already
thinking
about
disowning
broke
into
the
vault
and
took
birthright
You
nod
because
that
sounds
like
the
Binof
you
remember
You
skeptical
about
the
family
secret
though
Yumenes
didn
exist
before
Sanze
and
Sanze
only
the
latest
the
countless
civilizations
that
must
have
come
and
gone
over
the
Seasons
The
Leadership
legends
have
the
air
myth
concocted
justify
their
place
society
Tonkee
continues
cIn
the
vault
found
all
sorts
things:
maps
strange
writing
language
like
none
ever
seen
objects
that
didn
make
sense
like
one
tiny
perfectly
round
yellow
stone
about
inch
circumference
Someone
had
put
glass
case
sealed
and
plastered
with
warnings
not
touch
Apparently
the
thing
had
reputation
for
punching
holes
people
You
wince
cSo
either
there
some
truth
the
family
stories
amazingly
being
rich
and
powerful
makes
easy
assemble
quite
the
collection
valuable
ancient
objects
both
She
notices
your
expression
and
looks
amused
cYeah
probably
not
both
not
stonelore
anyway
just
words
Soft
knowledge
needed
harden
That
sounds
like
Tonkee
cSo
you
snuck
into
the
Fulcrum
try
find
the
socket
because
somehow
this
proves
some
rusty
old
story
your
family
passed
down
cIt
was
one
the
maps
found
Tonkee
shrugs
cIf
there
was
truth
part
the
story
about
there
being
socket
Yumenes
deliberately
hidden
away
the
city
founders
then
that
did
suggest
there
might
truth
the
rest
yes
Setting
the
knife
aside
Tonkee
shifts
get
comfortable
idly
brushing
the
shed
hairs
into
pile
with
one
hand
Her
hair
painfully
short
and
uneven
now
and
you
really
want
take
the
scissors
from
her
and
shape
You
wait
till
she
given
another
wash
first
though
cThere
truth
other
parts
the
stories
too
Tonkee
says
mean
lot
the
stories
are
rust
and
mellow
smoke
don
want
pretend
otherwise
But
learned
Seventh
that
the
obelisks
far
back
history
goes
and
then
some
have
evidence
Seasons
from
ten
fifteen
even
twenty
thousand
years
ago
and
the
obelisks
are
older
possible
that
they
even
predate
the
Shattering
The
first
Season
and
the
one
that
nearly
killed
the
world
Only
lorists
speak
and
the
Seventh
University
has
disavowed
most
their
tales
Out
contrariness
you
say
cMaybe
there
wasn
Shattering
Maybe
there
have
always
been
Fifth
Seasons
cMaybe
Tonkee
shrugs
either
not
noticing
your
attempt
obnoxious
not
caring
Probably
the
latter
cMentioning
the
Shattering
was
great
way
set
off
five
hour
argument
the
colloquium
Stupid
old
farts
She
smiles
herself
remembering
and
then
abruptly
sobers
You
understand
once
Dibars
the
city
that
housed
Seventh
the
Equatorials
only
little
west
Yumenes
don
believe
though
Tonkee
says
when
she
had
moment
recover
cThat
always
had
Seasons
cWhy
not
cBecause
She
grins
cLife
mean
not
different
enough
cWhat
Tonkee
leans
forward
She
not
quite
excited
she
gets
about
obelisks
but
clear
that
just
about
any
long
hidden
knowledge
sets
her
off
For
moment
the
gleam
her
open
cheeky
face
you
see
Binof
then
she
speaks
and
becomes
Tonkee
the
geomest
again
All
things
change
during
Season
yes
But
not
enough
Think
this
way:
Everything
that
grows
walks
land
can
breathe
the
world
air
eat
its
food
survive
its
usual
shifts
temperature
don
have
change
that
are
precisely
the
way
need
because
that
how
the
world
works
Right
Maybe
people
are
the
worst
the
lot
because
have
use
our
hands
make
coats
instead
just
growing
fur
but
can
make
coats
built
for
that
with
clever
hands
that
can
sew
and
brains
that
can
figure
out
how
hunt
grow
animals
for
fur
But
aren
built
filter
ash
out
our
lungs
before
turns
into
cement
cSome
animals
are
Tonkee
gives
you
ugly
look
cStop
interrupting
rude
You
sigh
and
gesture
for
her
and
she
nods
mollified
cNow
Yes
some
animals
grow
lung
filters
during
Season
start
breathing
water
and
move
into
the
ocean
where
safer
bury
themselves
and
hibernate
whatever
figured
out
how
build
not
just
coats
but
storecaches
and
walls
and
stonelore
But
these
are
afterthoughts
She
gestures
wildly
groping
for
the
words
cLike
when
cartwheel
blows
spoke
and
you
halfway
between
comms
you
improvise
See
You
put
stick
even
bar
metal
into
the
space
where
the
broken
spoke
was
just
keep
the
wheel
strong
enough
last
until
you
can
reach
wheelwright
That
what
happening
when
kirkhusa
suddenly
develop
taste
for
meat
during
Season
Why
don
they
just
eat
meat
all
the
time
Why
haven
they
always
eaten
meat
Because
they
were
originally
built
for
something
else
they
still
better
eating
something
else
and
eating
meat
during
Seasons
the
slapdash
last
minute
fix
nature
threw
keep
kirkhusa
from
going
extinct
cThat
You
little
awed
sounds
crazy
but
feels
right
somehow
You
can
think
any
holes
poke
the
theory
and
you
not
sure
you
want
Tonkee
not
someone
you
mean
toe
toe
with
battle
logic
Tonkee
nods
cThat
why
can
stop
thinking
about
the
obelisks
People
built
them
which
means
that
species
least
old
they
are
That
lot
time
break
things
start
over
and
break
them
again
the
Leadership
stories
are
true
maybe
enough
time
put
fix
place
Something
tide
over
till
the
real
repairs
can
made
You
frown
yourself
cWait
The
Yumenescene
Leadership
thinks
the
obelisks
leftover
deadciv
junk
are
the
fix
cBasically
The
stories
say
the
obelisks
held
the
world
together
when
would
have
come
apart
And
they
imply
there
might
someday
way
end
the
Seasons
involving
the
obelisks
end
all
Seasons
hard
even
imagine
need
for
runny
sacks
storecaches
Comms
could
last
forever
grow
forever
Every
city
could
become
like
Yumenes
cIt
would
amazing
you
murmur
Tonkee
glances
sharply
you
cOrogenes
might
kind
fix
too
you
know
she
says
cAnd
without
the
Seasons
you
longer
needed
You
frown
back
her
not
sure
whether
disquieted
comforted
that
statement
until
she
starts
finger
combing
her
remaining
hair
and
you
realize
you
run
out
things
say
orn
images

space

Hoa
gone
You
not
sure
where
You
left
him
behind
the
infirmary
staring
down
Ruby
Hair
and
when
you
returned
your
apartment
try
get
few
more
hours
sleep
was
not
beside
you
when
you
woke
His
little
bundle
rocks
still
your
room
next
your
bed
must
planning
return
soon
probably
nothing
Still
after
many
weeks
you
feel
oddly
bereft
without
his
strange
subtle
presence
But
perhaps
this
just
well
You
have
visit
make
and
might
easier
without
hostility
You
walk
the
infirmary
again
slowly
quietly
early
evening
you
think
always
hard
tell
Castrima
under
but
your
body
still
acclimated
the
rhythms
the
surface
For
now
you
trust
that
Some
the
people
out
the
platforms
and
walkways
stare
you
pass
this
comm
spends
plenty
time
gossiping
clearly
That
doesn
matter
All
that
does
whether
Alabaster
has
had
time
enough
recover
You
need
talk
There
sign
the
dead
Hunter
body
from
that
morning
everything
been
cleaned
Lerna
inside
fresh
clothing
and
glances
you
you
come
There
still
distance
his
expression
you
note
though
only
meets
your
gaze
for
moment
before
nodding
and
turning
back
whatever
doing
with
what
look
like
surgical
instruments
There
another
man
near
him
pipetting
something
into
series
small
glass
vials
the
man
doesn
even
look
infirmary
Anyone
can
come
not
until
you
halfway
down
the
infirmary
long
central
aisle
walking
between
the
rows
cots
that
you
consciously
notice
the
sound
you
been
hearing
all
along:
kind
hum
seems
monotonous
first
but
you
concentrate
you
detect
multiple
tones
harmonies
subtle
rhythm
Music
Music
alien
difficult
parse
that
you
not
sure
that
word
really
applies
You
can
figure
out
where
coming
from
first
Alabaster
still
where
you
saw
him
that
morning
pile
cushions
and
blankets
the
floor
telling
why
Lerna
hasn
put
him
cot
There
are
flasks
nightstand
nearby
roll
fresh
bandages
some
scissors
pot
salve
bedpan
thankfully
unused
since
its
last
cleaning
though
still
stinks
near
him
The
music
coming
from
the
stone
eater
you
realize
wonder
you
settle
into
crouch
before
them
Antimony
sits
cross
legged
near
Alabaster
cnest
utterly
still
looking
though
someone
bothered
sculpt
woman
sitting
cross
legged
with
one
hand
upraised
Alabaster
asleep
though
odd
nearly
sitting
posture
that
you
don
understand
until
you
realize
leaning
back
against
Antimony
hand
Maybe
that
the
only
way
can
sleep
comfortably
There
are
bandages
his
arms
today
shiny
with
salve
and
not
wearing
shirt
which
helps
you
see
that
not
badly
damaged
you
first
thought
There
are
patches
stone
his
chest
belly
and
only
few
small
burns
around
his
shoulders
most
those
healed
But
his
torso
nearly
skeletal
barely
any
muscle
ribs
showing
belly
almost
concave
Also
his
right
arm
much
shorter
than
was
that
morning
You
look
Antimony
The
music
coming
from
somewhere
inside
her
Her
black
eyes
are
focused
him
they
haven
moved
with
your
arrival
peaceful
this
strange
music
And
Alabaster
looks
comfortable
cYou
haven
been
taking
care
him
you
say
looking
his
ribs
and
remembering
countless
evenings
putting
food
front
him
glaring
while
wearily
chewed
conspiring
with
Innon
get
him
eat
the
group
meals
always
ate
more
when
thought
people
were
looking
cIf
you
were
going
steal
him
from
the
least
you
could
done
was
feed
him
properly
Fatten
him
before
you
ate
him
something
The
music
continues
There
very
faint
stone
grating
sound
her
black
cabochon
eyes
shift
you
last
They
such
alien
eyes
despite
their
superficial
resemblance
human
You
can
see
the
dry
matte
material
that
comprises
the
whites
her
eyes
veins
spots
off
white
coloring
that
would
indicate
weariness
worry
anything
else
human
You
can
even
tell
there
are
pupils
within
the
black
her
irises
For
all
you
know
she
can
even
see
with
them
and
uses
her
elbows
detect
your
presence
and
direction
You
meet
those
eyes
and
realize
suddenly
that
there
little
left
you
which
capable
fear
cYou
took
him
from
and
couldn
alone
that
lie
incompleteness
Innon
feral
had
hope
against
Guardians
and
trained
Fulcrum
orogene
You
though
You
the
one
who
fucked
everything
couldn
alone
Alabaster
had
been
there
hated
you
Afterward
while
was
wandering
vowed
find
way
kill
you
Put
you
obelisk
like
that
other
one
Bury
you
the
ocean
far
enough
out
that
one
will
ever
dig
you
She
watches
you
and
says
nothing
You
can
even
read
the
catch
her
breath
because
she
doesn
breathe
But
the
music
stops
dying
into
silence
That
reaction
least
This
really
pointless
But
then
the
silence
looms
louder
and
you
still
feeling
kind
pissy
you
add:
cShame
The
music
was
pretty
(Later
lying
bed
and
considering
the
day
errors
you
will
think
belatedly
crazy
now
Alabaster
was
back
then
moment
later
Alabaster
stirs
lifting
his
head
and
uttering
soft
groan
that
throws
your
thoughts
and
your
heart
ten
years
away
before
they
circle
back
blinks
you
disorientation
for
moment
and
you
realize
doesn
recognize
you
with
your
hair
twice
long
and
your
skin
weathered
and
your
clothes
Season
faded
Then
blinks
again
and
you
take
deep
breath
and
you

almost

stirs

carefully
and
then
heard

Alabaster
But
doesn

just
looking
you
and
you
sigh
All
right
You
look
his
arm
which
stops
the
elbow
now
and
wonder
what
means
look
inside
Then
unbidden
you
remember
night
when
willed
poison
out
the
cells
his
own
body
But
had
help
for
that
You
frown
impulsively
glancing
the
strangely
shaped
pink
object
behind
him
the
thing
that
looks
like
overly
long
big
handled
knife
and
which
actually
somehow
obelisk
The
spinel
called
You
glance
him
must
have
seen
you
eye
doesn
move:
not
twitch
his
burned
and
stone
crusted
face
not
flicker
his
nonexistent
eyelashes
All
right
then
Anything
goes
long
you
what
says
you
stare
down
his
arm
You
don
want
chance
the
spinel
telling
what
will
Instead
first
you
try
letting
your
awareness
into
the
arm
This
feels
absurd
you
spent
your
life
sessing
layers
earth
miles
underground
your
surprise
however
your
perception
can
grasp
his
arm
small
and
strange
too
close
and
almost
too
tiny
but
there
because
least
the
outermost
layer
him
rock
Calcium
and
carbon
and
flecks
oxidized
iron
that
must
have
once
been
blood
and
You
pause
frowning
and
open
your
eyes
(You
don
remember
closing
them
cWhat
that
cWhat
that
The
side
his
mouth
that
hasn
been
seamed
burn
lifts

You
scowl

something
this

cCan
you

down

You

But
when
you
narrow
your
focus
the
limit
that
you
can
when
you
squint
and
press
your
tongue
the
roof
your
mouth
and
wrinkle
your
nose
there
too
Big
sticky
globules
all
bouncing
against
one
another
You
withdraw
once
revolted
least
stone
clean
cLook
again
Syen
Don
coward
You
could
annoyed
but
you
too
old
for
this
shit
now
Setting
your
jaw
you
try
again
taking
deep
breath
you
won
feel
queasy
Everything
wet
inside
him
and
the
water
isn
even
sequestered
away
between
layers
clay
You
pause
Narrow
your
focus
still
further
Between
the
gelidity
moving
too
but
slower
and
less
organic
way
you
suddenly
sess
the
same
thing
you
found
the
stone
him
Something
else
neither
flesh
nor
stone
Something
immaterial
and
yet
there
for
you
perceive
glimmers
threads
strung
between
the
bits
him
crossing
itself
lattices
shifting
constantly
tension
energy
shiny
and
streaming
Potential
Intention
You
shake
your
head
pulling
back
you
can
focus
him
cWhat
that
This
time
answers
cThe
stuff
orogeny
makes
his
voice
dramatic
since
his
facial
expressions
can
change
much
told
you
before
that
what
isn
logical
make
the
earth
move
put
something
ourselves
into
the
system
and
make
completely
unrelated
things
come
out
There
always
been
something
else
involved
connecting
the
two
This
You
frown
sits
forward
growing
more
animated
with
his
excitement
just
the
way
used
the
old
days
but
then
something
creaks
him
and
flinches
with
pain
Carefully
sits
back
against
Antimony
hand
again
But
you
hearing
him
And
right
hasn
ever
really
made
sense
has
the
way
orogeny
works
shouldn
work
all
that
willpower
and
concentration
and
perception
should
shift
mountains
Nothing
else
the
world
works
this
way
People
cannot
stop
avalanches
dancing
well
make
storms
happen
refining
their
hearing
And
some
level
you
always
known
that
this
was
there
making
your
will
manifest
This
whatever
Alabaster
has
always
been
able
read
you
like
book
cThe
civilization
that
made
the
obelisks
had
word
for
this
says
nodding
your
epiphany
think
there
reason
don
because
one
for
countless
generations
has
wanted
orogenes
understand
what
They
just
wanted
You
nod
slowly
cAfter
Allia
can
see
why
one
would
wanted
learn
how
manipulate
obelisks
cRust
the
obelisks
They
didn
want
create
something
better
worse
takes
deep
breath
carefully
cWe
going
stop
manipulating

now
Essun
That
stuff
you
see
That
what
you
have
learn
control
perceive
wherever
exists
what
the
obelisks
are
made
and
how
they
what
they
have
get
you
those
things
too
have
make
you
ten
ringer
least
least
Just
like
that
Why
Alabaster
you
mentioned
something
moon
Tonkee
doesn
have
clue
what
that
And
all
the
things
you
said
about
causing
that
rift
and
wanting
something
worse
Something
moves
the
periphery
your
vision
You
glance
and
realize
the
man
who
been
working
with
Lerna
coming
with
bowl
his
hands
Dinner
for
Alabaster
You
drop
your
voice
not
the
way
Helping
you
make
things
worse
Haven
you
done
enough
already
Alabaster
glances
the
oncoming
nurse
too
Watching
him
Alabaster
says
low
voice
cThe
Moon
something
this
world
used
have
Essun
object
the
sky
much
closer
than
the
stars
keeps
switching
between
calling
you
one
name
and
another
distracting
cIts
loss
was
part
what
caused
the
Seasons
Father
Earth
did
not
always
hate
life
the
lorists
say
hates
because
cannot
forgive
the
loss
his
only
child
But
then
the
lorists
tales
also
say
the
obelisks
are
harmless
cHow
you
know
But
then
you
stop
because
the
man
has
reached
you
you
sit
back
against
nearby
cot
digesting
what
you
heard
while
spoon
feeds
Alabaster
The
stuff
watery
mash
some
kind
and
not
much
Alabaster
sits
there
and
opens
his
mouth
for
the
feeding
like
babe
His
eyes
stay
you
throughout
unnerving
and
finally
you
have
look
away
Some
the
things
that
have
changed
between
you
you
cannot
bear
Finally
the
man
done
and
with
flat
look
your
direction
that
nevertheless
conveys
his
opinion
that
you
should
have
been
the
one
administer
the
food
leaves
But
when
you
straighten
and
open
your
mouth
ask
more
questions
Alabaster
says
probably
going
need
use
that
bedpan
soon
can
control
bowels
very
well
anymore
but
least
they
still
regular
the
look
your
face
smiles
with
only
hint
bitterness
don
want
you
see
that
any
more
than
you
want
see
why
don
just
say
you
should
come
back
later
Noon
seems
work
better
for
not
interfering
with
any
gross
natural
functions
That
isn
fair
Well
and
you
deserve
his
censure
but
censure
that
should
shared
cWhy
did
you
this
yourself
You
gesture
his
arm
his
ruined
body
just
Maybe
you
could
take
better
you
understood
cThe
consequence
what
did
Yumenes
shook
his
head
cSomething
remember
Syen
for
when
you
make
your
own
choices
the
future:
Some
them
come
with
terrible
price
Although
sometimes
that
price
worth
paying
You
can
understand
why
sees
this
this
horrible
slow
death
price
worth
paying
for
anything
let
alone
for
what
got
out
which
was
the
destruction
the
world
And
you
still
don
understand
what
any
has
with
stone
eaters
moons
obelisks
anything
else
cWouldn
have
been
better
you
cannot
help
saying
cto
just
live
have
come
back
you
cannot
say
have
made
what
little
life
could
with
Syenite
again
after
Meov
was
gone
but
before
she
found
Tirimo
and
Jija
and
tried
create
lesser
version
the
family
she
lost
Before
she
became
you
The
answer
the
way
his
eyes
deaden
This
was
the
look
that
was
his
face
you
stood
node
station
once
over
the
abused
corpse
one
his
sons
Maybe
the
look
that
was
his
face
when
learned
Innon
death
certainly
what
you
saw
your
own
face
after
Uche
That
when
you
longer
need
answer
the
question
There
such
thing
too
much
loss
Too
much
has
been
taken
from
you
both
taken
and
taken
and
taken
until
there
nothing
left
but
hope
and
you
given
that
because
hurts
too
much
Until
you
would
rather
die
kill
avoid
attachments
altogether
than
lose
one
more
thing
You
think
the
feeling
that
was
your
heart
you
pressed
hand
over
Corundum
nose
and
mouth
Not
the
thought
The
thought
was
simple
and
predictable:
Better
die
than
live
slave
But
what
you
felt
that
moment
was
kind
cold
monstrous
love
determination
make
sure
your
son
life
remained
the
beautiful
wholesome
thing
that
had
been
that
day
even
meant
you
had
end
his
life
early
Alabaster
doesn
answer
your
question
You
don
need
him
anymore
You
get
leave
that
can
least
keep
his
dignity
front
you
because
that
really
all
you
have
left
give
him
Your
love
and
respect
aren
worth
much
anyone
Maybe
you
still
thinking
dignity
when
you
ask
one
more
question
that
the
conversation
doesn
end
note
hopelessness
your
way
offering
olive
branch
too
and
letting
him
know
that
you
decided
learn
what
has
teach
you
You
not
interested
making
the
Season
worse
whatever
about
but
clear
that
needs
this
some
level
The
son
made
with
you
dead
the
family
you
built
together
has
been
rendered
forever
incomplete
but
nothing
else
still
your
mentor
(You
need
this
too
cynical
part
you
notes
poor
trade
really
Nassun
for
him

for

these
ridiculous
mysteries
for
the

But

you

Anything
