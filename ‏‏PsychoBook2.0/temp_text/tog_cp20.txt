HAS
BEEN
ONE
MONTH
since
you
last
went
aboveground
has
been
two
days
since
you
killed
Alabaster
your
folly
and
pain
All
things
change
Season
Castrima
over
occupied
The
tunnel
that
you
first
passed
through
enter
the
comm
blocked
one
the
comm
orogenes
has
pulled
big
slab
stone
from
the
earth
effectively
seal
off
Probably
Ykka
Cutter
before
Ykka
killed
him
they
were
the
two
others
the
comm
with
the
best
fine
control
besides
you
and
Alabaster
Now
two
those
four
are
dead
and
the
enemy
the
gates
The
Strongbacks
who
are
clustered
the
tunnel
mouth
behind
the
stone
seal
jump
you
walk
into
the
electric
light
circle
and
the
ones
who
were
already
standing
stand
straighter
Xeber
Esni
second
command
among
the
Strongbacks
actually
smiles
the
sight
you
That
how
bad
things
are
That
how
worried
everyone
They
lost
their
minds
think
you
their
champion
don
like
this
Ykka
has
said
you
She
back
the
comm
organizing
the
defense
that
will
necessary
the
tunnels
are
breached
The
real
danger
the
Rennanis
scouts
discover
the
ventilation
ducts
Castrima
geode
They
well
hidden
one
the
cavern
underground
river
others
equally
out
the
way
places
the
people
who
built
Castrima
feared
attack
themselves
but
the
comm
people
will
forced
out
those
are
sealed
off
cAnd
they
got
stone
eaters
working
with
them
You
dangerous
and
ruster
enough
fuck
army
Essie
give
you
that
but
none
can
fight
stone
eaters
they
kill
you
lose
our
best
weapon
She
said
this
you
Scenic
Overlook
where
the
two
you
went
work
things
out
was
awkward
for
about
day
between
you
forbidding
vote
you
undercut
Ykka
authority
and
destroyed
everyone
illusion
having
say
the
comm
management
That
was
necessary
you
still
believe
everyone
shouldn
have
say
whose
life
worth
fighting
for
She
actually
agreed
she
admitted
you
talked
But
damaged
her
You
didn
apologize
for
that
but
you
tried
spackle
the
cracks
You
are
Castrima
best
weapon
you
said
firmly
You
even
meant
That
Castrima
has
lasted
this
far
comm
stills
who
have
repeatedly
failed
lynch
the
roggas
openly
living
among
them
miraculous
Even
chasn
yet
committed
genocidal
slaughter
low
bar
hop
other
communities
haven
even
managed
that
much
You
give
credit
where
due
eased
the
awkwardness
between
you
cWell
just
don
rusting
die
she
told
you
last
cNot
sure
can
keep
this
mess
together
without
you
this
point
Ykka
good
that
making
people
feel
like
they
got
reason
something
That
why
she
the
headwoman
And
that
why
now
you
walk
through
Castrima
over
that
has
been
turned
into
camp
the
soldiers
Rennanis
and
you
are
actually
afraid
always
harder
fight
for
other
people
than
for
the
self
The
ash
has
been
falling
steadily
for
year
now
and
the
comm
knee
deep
the
stuff
There
been
least
one
rain
tamp
down
recently
you
can
sess
kind
damp
mud
crust
underneath
the
powdery
layer
top
but
even
that
substantial
Enemy
soldiers
crowd
the
porches
and
doorways
the
once
empty
houses
watching
you
and
the
untamped
ash
under
the
eaves
halfway
most
the
houses
walls
They
had
dig
out
the
windows
The
soldiers
look
like
just
people
because
they
don
wear
uniforms
but
there
uniformity
them
nevertheless:
They
are
all
fully
Sanzed
very
Sanzed
looking
Where
you
can
see
color
their
ash
faded
travel
clothing
you
spot
that
telltale
scrap
prettier
more
delicate
cloth
tied
around
their
upper
arms
wrists
foreheads
longer
displaced
Equatorials
then
they
found
comm
Something
older
and
more
primal
than
comm:
They
are
tribe
And
now
they
here
take
what
yours
But
beyond
that
they
are
just
people
Many
are
your
age
older
You
guess
that
lot
them
are
surplus
Strongbacks
commless
trying
prove
their
usefulness
There
are
slightly
more
men
than
women
but
that
follows
too
since
most
comms
are
quicker
kick
out
those
who
can
produce
babies
than
those
who
can
but
the
number
women
here
means
that
Rennanis
isn
hurting
for
healthy
repopulators
strong
comm
Their
eyes
follow
you
you
walk
down
Castrima
over
main
street
You
stand
out
you
know
with
your
ashless
skin
and
clean
hair
and
your
clothes
bright
with
color
Just
brown
leather
pants
and
unbleached
white
your
shirt
but
these
are
colors
that
have
become
rare
this
world
gray
streets
and
gray
dead
trees
and
gray
heavily
clouded
sky
You
the
only
Midlatter
that
you
see
too
and
you
small
compared
most
them
Doesn
matter
Behind
you
floats
the
spinel
remaining
precisely
one
foot
behind
the
back
your
head
and
turning
slowly
You
aren
making
that
You
don
know
why
doing
that
really
Unless
you
hold
your
hand
that
what
the
thing
does:
You
tried
set
down
but
floated
back
and
moved
behind
you
like
this
Should
asked
Alabaster
how
make
behave
before
you
killed
him
well
Now
flickering
little
real
translucent
real
again
and
you
can
hear
not
sess
hear
the
faint
hum
its
energies
turns
You
see
people
faces
twitch
they
notice
They
might
not
know
what
but
they
know
bad
thing
when
they
hear
the
center
Castrima
over
domed
open
pavilion
that
Ykka
tells
you
was
once
the
comm
gathering
center
used
for
wedding
dances
and
parties
and
the
occasional
comm
wide
meeting
been
turned
into
some
sort
operations
center
you
see
you
walk
toward
it:
gaggle
men
and
women
stand
squat
sit
around
within
but
one
knot
them
stands
around
freshly
made
table
When
you
get
close
enough
you
see
that
they
got
crudely
made
diagram
Castrima
and
map
the
local
area
side
side
which
they
discussing
your
dismay
you
can
see
that
they
marked
least
one
the
ventilation
ducts
the
one
that
behind
small
waterfall
the
nearby
river
They
probably
lost
scout
two
finding
it:
The
river
banks
are
now
infested
with
boilbug
mounds
Doesn
matter
they
found
and
that
bad
Three
the
people
talking
over
the
maps
look
you
approach
One
them
elbows
another
who
turns
and
shakes
awake
someone
else
you
walk
into
the
pavilion
and
stop
few
feet
from
the
table
The
woman
who
gets
rubbing
her
face
blearily
she
comes
join
the
others
does
not
look
particularly
impressive
She
cut
her
hair
the
sides
just
above
her
ears
painfully
blunt
chop
that
looks
have
been
done
with
knife
makes
her
look
small
even
though
she
not
particularly:
Her
torso
smooth
barrel
brief
breasts
blending
into
belly
that
probably
carried
least
one
child
and
legs
like
basalt
pillars
She
not
wearing
anything
more
than
the
others
her
sash
tribe
membership
just
fading
yellow
silk
kerchief
hanging
loosely
around
her
neck
But
there
gravity
her
gaze
even
half
asleep
that
makes
you
focus
her
cCastrima
she
asks
you
way
greeting
all
that
really
matters
about
who
you
are
anyway
You
nod
speak
for
them
She
rests
her
hands
the
table
nodding
cOur
message
got
delivered
then
Her
gaze
flicks
the
spinel
hovering
behind
you
and
something
adjusts
her
expression
not
hate
that
you
seeing
Hate
requires
emotion
What
this
woman
has
simply
done
realize
you
are
rogga
and
decide
that
you
aren
person
just
like
that
Indifference
worse
than
hate
Well
You
can
muster
indifference
response
you
can
help
but
see
her
human
Have
make
with
hate
then
And
what
more
interesting
that
she
somehow
knows
what
the
spinel
and
what
means
Very
interesting
cWe
not
joining
you
you
say
cYou
want
fight
over
that
She
tilts
her
head
one
side
One
her
lieutenants
chuckles
into
their
hand
but
swiftly
glared
silent
another
You
like
the
silencing
respectful
your
abilities
not
you
per
and
Castrima
even
they
don
think
you
have
chance
Even
you
actually
probably
don
have
chance
cWe
don
even
have
attack
you
realize
the
woman
says
cWe
can
just
sit
here
kill
anybody
who
comes
hunt
trade
Starve
you
out
You
manage
not
react
cWe
have
little
meat
take
awhile
months
least
for
the
vitamin
deficiencies
set
Our
stores
are
pretty
solid
otherwise
You
force
shrug
cAnd
other
communities
have
gotten
around
meat
shortages
easily
enough
She
grins
Her
teeth
aren
sharpened
but
you
think
momentarily
that
her
canines
are
longer
than
they
strictly
need
probably
projection
cTrue
that
your
taste
Which
why
also
working
finding
your
vents
She
taps
the
map
cClose
them
and
suffocate
you
till
you
weak
then
break
down
those
barriers
you
put
across
the
tunnels
and
dance
right
Stupid
live
underground
once
someone
knows
you
there
you
actually
easier
target
not
harder
one
This
true
but
you
shake
your
head
cWe
can
hard
enough
you
push
But
Castrima
isn
rich
and
our
storecaches
aren
any
better
than
those
another
comm
that
not
full
roggas
You
pause
for
effect
The
woman
doesn
flinch
but
there
shuffle
among
the
other
people
the
pavilion
they
realize
Good
That
means
they
thinking
cSo
many
easier
nuts
crack
out
there
Why
are
you
bothering
with
You
know
why
they
really
doing
this
because
Gray

that

even
possible
with

Rift
cranking
out

and

nearby
Doubtful
they
have
any
livestock
maybe
they
facing
meat
shortage
too
cBecause
this
what
will
take
survive
the
woman
says
your
surprise
She
straightens
and
folds
her
arms
cRennanis
has
too
many
people
for
our
stores
All
the
survivors
every
other
Equatorial
city
have
come

our
doorstep
would
had
this
anyway
have
problems
with
too
large
commless
population
the
area
Might
well
weaponize
them
into
feeding
themselves
and
bringing
what
left
back
home
the
comm
You
know
this
Season
isn
going
end
cIt
will
cEventually
She
shrugs
cOur
mests
have
calculated
that
grow
enough
shrooms
and
such
and
strictly
limit
our
population
might
achieve
enough
sustainability
survive
until
the
Season
ends
The
odds
are
better
take
the
storecaches
every
other
comm
encounter
though
You
roll
your
eyes
because
you
can
help
cYou
think
cachebread
going
last
thousand
years
two
ten
And
then
few
hundred
thousand
years

She
pauses
until
you
done
and
set
supply
lines
from
every
comm
with
renewables
need
some
Coastal
comms
with
oceanic
resources
some
Antarctics
where
growing
low
light
plants
might
still
possible
She
pauses
also
for
effect
cBut
you
Midlatters
eat
too
much
Well
cSo
basically
you
here
wipe
out
You
shake
your
head
cWhy
didn
you
just
say
Why
the
foolishness
about
getting
rid
the
orogenes
Someone
from
beyond
the
pavilion
calls
cDanel
and
the
woman
looks
nodding
absently
This
apparently
her
name
cAlways
chance
you
turn
each
other
Then
could
just
walk
and
scrape
the
leftovers
She
shakes
her
head
cNow
things
have
hard
The
dull
insistent
buzz
that
suddenly
impinges
itself
your
sessapinae
warning
blatant
scream
too
late
the
instant
you
sess
because
that
means
you
within
range
the
Guardian
ability
negate
your
orogeny
You
turn
anyway
half
tripping
even
you
start
spin
huge
torus
that
will
flash
freeze
the
whole
rusting
town
and
because
you
were
expecting
negation
and
did
not
deploy
tight
shielding
torus
that
the
disruption
knife
pegs
you
the
right
arm
You
remember
Alabaster
saying
that
these
knives
hurt
The
thing
small
made
for
throwing
and
should
hurt
given
that
sunk
into
your
bicep
and
probably
chipping
bone
But
what
Alabaster
did
not
specify
you
are
irrationally
furious
with
him
hours
after
his
death
stupid
useless
ruster
was
that
something
about
this
knife
seems
set
your
entire
nervous
system
fire
The
fire
hottest
incandescent
your
sessapinae
even
though
those
are
nowhere
near
your
arm
hurts
much
that
all
your
muscles
spasm
once
you
flop
onto
your
side
and
can
even
scream
You
just
lie
there
twitching
and
staring
the
woman
who
steps
through
the
gaggle
Rennanis
soldiers
grin
down
you
She
surprisingly
young
she
seems
though
appearances
are
meaningless
because
she
Guardian
She
naked
from
the
waist
her
skin
shockingly
dark
amid
all
these
Sanzeds
her
breasts
small
and
almost
entirely
areola
reminding
you
the
last
time
you
were
pregnant
You
thought
your
tits
would
never
shrink
back
down
after
Uche
and
you
wonder
will
hurt
when
you
are
shaken
pieces
the
way
Innon
was
Everything
goes
black
You
don
understand
what
happened
first
Are
you
dead
Was
that
quick
Everything
still
fire
and
you
think
you
still
trying
scream
But
you
become
aware
new
sensations
then
Movement
Rushing
Something
rather
like
wind
The
touch
foreign
molecules
against
infinitesimal
receptors
your
skin
oddly
peaceful
You
almost
forget
your
pain
Then
light
startling
against
the
eyelids
you
hadn
realized
you
closed
You
can
open
them
Someone
curses
nearby
and
comes
near
and
hands
press
you
down
which
nearly
makes
you
panic
because
you
can
orogeny
with
your
nerves
exploding
like
this
But
then
someone
yanks
the
knife
out
your
arm
though
shake
siren
within
you
has
been
suddenly
silenced
You
slump
relief
into
just
ordinary
pain
and
open
your
eyes
now
that
you
can
control
your
voluntary
muscles
again
Lerna
there
You
the
floor
his
apartment
the
light
from
his
crystal
walls
and
holding
the
knife
and
staring
down
you
Beyond
him
Hoa
stands
pose
entreaty
which
must
have
been
directing
toward
Lerna
His
eyes
have
shifted
you
though
hasn
bothered
adjust
the
pose
cBurning
rusty
fuck
you
groan
sigh
And
then
because
now
you
know
what
must
have
happened
you
add
cThanks
Hoa
Who
pulled
you
down
into
the
earth
and
away
before
the
Guardian
could
kill
you
Never
thought
you
grateful
for
something
like
that
Lerna
dropped
the
knife
and
already
turned
away
find
bandages
You
not
bleeding
much
the
knife
went
vertically
paralleling
rather
than
cutting
across
the
tendons
and
seems
have
missed
the
big
artery
Hard
tell
when
your
hands
are
still
shaking
little
shock
But
Lerna
not
moving
that
blurring
near
inhuman
speed
tends
use
when
life
the
line
you
encouraged
that
Lerna
says
his
back
you
assembles
items
take
your
attempt
parley
didn
well
Things
have
been
awkward
between
you
and
him
lately
made
his
interest
clear
and
you
haven
responded
kind
You
haven
rejected
him
either
though
thus
the
awkwardness
one
point
few
weeks
back
Alabaster
grumbled
that
you
should
just
roll
the
boy
already
because
you
were
always
crankier
when
you
were
horny
You
called
him
ass
and
changed
the
subject
but
really
Alabaster
why
you
been
thinking
about
more
You
keep
thinking
about
Alabaster
too
though
this
grief
You
hated
him
loved
him
missed
him
for
years
made
yourself
forget
him
found
him
again
loved
him
again
killed
him
The
grief
does
not
feel
like
what
you
feel
about
Uche
Corundum
Innon
those
are
rents
your
soul
that
still
seep
blood
The
loss
Alabaster
simply
thinning
who
you
are
And
maybe
now
not
the
time
consider
your
cataclysm
love
life
cNo
you
say
You
shrug
off
your
jacket
Underneath
you
wearing
sleeveless
shirt
good
for
Castrima
warmth
Lerna
turns
back
and
crouches
and
begins
swabbing
away
the
blood
with
pad
soft
rags
cYou
were
right
shouldn
have
gone
there
They
had
Guardian
Lerna
eyes
flick
yours
then
back
your
wound
heard
they
could
stop
orogeny
cThis
one
didn
have
That
damned
knife
did
for
her
You
think
you
know
why
too
you
remember
Innon
That
Guardian
didn
negate
him
either
Maybe
the
skin
thing
only
works
roggas
whose
orogeny
still
active
That
how
she
wanted
kill
you
But
Lerna
jaw
muscle
already
tight
and
you
decide
maybe
doesn
need
know
that
didn
know
about
the
Guardian
Hoa
says
unexpectedly
sorry
You
eye
him
didn
expect
stone
eaters
omniscient
said
would
protect
you
His
voice
more
inflectionless
now
that
not
flesh
shape
anymore
maybe
his
voice
the
same
and
you
just
read

This

Young

Maybe
just
open

That

Lerna

Between

you

Afterward

Flat
Top
where
Ykka
has
set
operations
center
her
own
Someone
brought
the
rest
the
divans
from
her
apartment
and
she
set
them
rough
semicircle
basically
bringing
her
council
out
into
the
open
token
this
Hjarka
sprawls
over

she
usually
does
head
propped

and
taking

down
and
Tonkee
pacing
the

the

There
are

around
anxious
bored
people
who
brought
their
own

are
sitting
the
hard
crystal

but
not
many
you
would
expected
There
lot
activity
around
the

you
noticed
you
headed

people
fletching

one

that
you

another
Down
the

level
you
can
see
what
looks

longknife

slender
young

teaching

how
over

Over
Scenic
Overlook
some
the

seem
rigging
what
looks
like

The
spectators
perk
you
and
Lerna
come
onto
the
Flat
Top
though
that
hilarious
Everyone

Rennanis
You
did
this

that
you

Everyone
seems
reading

that
you
may
crazy
but

you
their

Such
hope
their

dies
down
quickly
though
That
you
are
back
and
that
there
visibly
bloody
bandage
around
one
arm
reassuring
one
Tonkee
full
rant
about
something
Even
she
ready
for

having
traded
her

for
billowy
pantaloons
tied
her
hair
atop
her
head
scruffy
pile
curls
and
strapped
twin
glassknives
both

She
actually
looks
kind
stunning
Then
you
pay
attention
what
she
saying
cThe

cAt

Tonkee
stops

her
cThat

She
sees
you
then
and
stops
her

going
immediately
the

around
your

Ykka
turns
and
her

widen
too
cDamn
You
shake

And
now

Then
you

the

cHow

against
Ykka
least
they
aren

right
now
even
though
they
now
know
she
was
keeping
the

from

Headwomen
are
supposed
make

like
that
cHow
are
they
finding
the
rusting
vents
cWith
enough
people
not
hard
search
you
start

she
cuts
you
off
cIt
been
using
this
geode
one

another
for
fifty
years
know
the

and
took
years
find
those
vents
One
damned
peat
bog
further
along
the
river
which
stinks
the
heavens
and
occasionally
catches
fire
She
sits
forward
propping
her
elbows
her
knees
and
sighing
cHow
did
they
even
know
were
here
Even
our
trading
partners
have
only
ever
seen
Castrima
over
cMaybe
they
have

working
with

Lerna
says
After

artificial

Ykka
She

When

notice
giant

You
blink
surprise
She
nods
before
you
can
answer
since
your
face
has
said
all
cYeah
you
should
have
but
something
about
this

sort
don
know
Shunts
away
orogeny
Once
you
the
opposite

the
geode
feeds
power
itself
But
next
time
you
topside
and
not
being
almost
killed
mean
try
sessing
this

You
see
what
talking
about
She
shakes
her
head
cEven
they
got
pet
roggas
they
shouldn
have
known
were
here
Hjarka
sighs
and
rolls
onto
her
back
muttering
under
her

Tonkee
bares
her
teeth
probably

she
picking
from
Hjarka
cThat
not

Tonkee
snaps
cBecause
you

Hjarka
says
cDoesn

wrong
You

You

Ykka

Hjarka
rolls

grinning

flashing
her

gone

She
was
Leadership
there
before
she
left

and
she
wanted

left

full

definitely
wasn

useless

She
looks
Ykka
Ykka
sighs
long
suffering
way
can
believe
you
still
mad
didn
ash
you
told
you
needed
the
help
cRight
But
just
saying:
wouldn
have
stayed
you
asked
the
time
cYou
rather
have
some
overcrowded
Equatorial

with
delusions
being
Old
Sanze

Lerna
frowns

Hjarka
shrugs
like
here
now
But
saying
that
somebody
else
might
prefer
Rennanis
Enough
sell
out
for
place
cWe
need
find
this
spy
shouts
someone
from
over
near
the
rope
bridge
cNo
you
say
then
sharply
your
teacher
voice
and
everyone
jumps
and
looks
you
cDanel
said
she
hoped
make
Castrima
tear
itself
apart
not
starting
any
rogga
hunts
here
This
has
two
meanings
but
you
not
trying
clever
You
know
full
well
that
your
teacher
voice
isn
the
only
reason
everyone
staring
you
palpable
unease
The
spinel
still
floats
behind
you
having
followed
you
down
from
the
surface
Ykka
rubs
her
eyes
cYou
gotta
stop
threatening
people
Essie
mean
know
you
grew
the
Fulcrum
and
don
really
know
any
better
but
not
good
community
behavior
You
blink
little
thrown
and
lot
insulted
But
she
right
Comms
survive
through
careful
balance
trust
and
fear
Your
impatience
tilting
the
balance
too
far
out
true
cFine
you
say
Everyone
relaxes
little
relieved
that
Ykka
can
talk
you
down
and
there
are
even
few
nervous
chuckles
cBut
still
don
think
relevant
discuss
whether
there
spy
right
now
there
Rennanis
knows
what
they
know
All
can
try
come
with
plan
they
won
anticipate
Tonkee
points
you
and
glares
Hjarka
with
wordless
See
Hjarka
sits
forward
planting
hand
one
knee
and
glaring
all
you
She
doesn
usually
argue
much
that
was
Cutter
role
but
you
see
stubbornness
the
set
her
jaw
now
cIt
rusting
matters
the
spy
still
here
though
Good
luck
keeping
them
from
anticipating
The
commotion
begins
Scenic
Overlook
hard
see
from
Flat
Top
but
someone
shouting
for
Ykka
She
her
feet
once
heading
that
direction
but
small
figure
one
the
comm
children
working
runner
comes
darting
along
the
pathways
meet
her
before
she
even
crossed
the
main
bridge
from
Flat
Top
cMessage
from
the
topside
tunnels
the
boy
calls
even
before
halts
cSays
the
Rennies
are
sledgehammering
Ykka
looks
Tonkee
Tonkee
nods
briskly
cMorat
said
the
charges
were
set
cWait
what
you
ask
Ykka
ignores
you
the
child
she
says
cTell
them
fall
back
and
follow
the
plan
The
boy
turns
and
runs
off
though
only
point
where
got
clear
sight
line
Scenic
holds
hand
clenches
fist
and
then
releases
splay
fingers
There
series
whistles
throughout
the
comm
this
signal
gets
relayed
and
lot
bustling
clusters
people
gather
and
head
off
into
the
tunnels
You
recognize
some
them:
Strongbacks
and
Innovators
You
have
idea
what
going
Ykka
seems
remarkably
calm
she
turns
back
face
you
cGoing
need
your
help
she
says
softly
cIf
they
using
sledgehammers
then
that
good
they
don
have
any
roggas
But
collapsing
the
tunnels
will
only
hold
them
for
short
time
they
really
determined
come
down
here
And
don
much
like
the
idea
being
trapped
Will
you
help
build
escape
tunnel
You
draw
back
little
stunned
Collapsing
the
tunnels
But
course
the
only
strategy
that
makes
sense
Castrima
cannot
fight
off
army
that
outnumbers
them
out
weapons
them
and
out
allies
them
stone
eaters
and
Guardians
cWhat
are
supposed
flee
Ykka
shrugs
You
understand
now
why
she
looks
tired
not
just
dealing
with
the
comm
almost
turning
its
roggas
but
fear
for
the
future
cIt
contingency
had
people
carrying
critical
stores
into
side
caverns
for
days
now
can
carry
all
course
even
most
But
leave
and
hide
somewhere
got
place
before
you
ask
storage
cavern
few
miles
away
then
even
the
Rennies
break
they
find
comm
that
dark
and
worthless
and
that
will
suffocate
them
they
stay
too
long
They
take
what
they
can
and
and
maybe
can
come
back
when
they
done
And
this
why
she
the
headwoman:
While
you
been
caught
your
own
dramas
Ykka
been
doing
all
this
Still
cIf
they
have
even
one
rogga
with
them
the
geode
will
function
theirs
commless
cYeah
contingency
plan
blows
you
right
Ykka
sighs
cWhich
why
want
try
Tonkee
plan
Hjarka
looks
furious
rusting
told
you
don
want
headwoman
Yeek
Ykka
rolls
her
eyes
cYou
rather
commless
Suck
You
turn
from
her
Tonkee
and
back
feeling
completely
lost
Tonkee
sighs
frustration
but
forces
herself
explain
cControlled
orogeny
she
says
cSustained
bursts
slow
cooling
the
surface
ring
around
the
area
but
closing
inward
centered
the
comm
This
will
excite
the
boilbugs
into
swarm
state
The
other
Innovators
have
been
studying
their
behavior
for
weeks
She
flicks
her
fingers
little
perhaps
unconsciously
dismissing
that
sort
research
lesser
cIt
should
work
But
has
done
fast
someone
who
has
the
necessary
precision
and
endurance
The
bugs
just
dig
and
into
hibernation
otherwise
Suddenly
you
understand
monstrous
could
also
save
Castrima
And
yet
you
look
Ykka
Ykka
shrugs
but
you
think
you
read
tension
her
shoulders
You
have
never
understood
how
Ykka
does
the
things
she
does
with
orogeny
She
feral
theory
she
capable
doing
anything
you
can
dedicated
self
teacher
could
conceivably
master
the
basics
and
then
refine
them
from
there
Most
self
taught
roggas
just
don
But
you
sessed
Ykka
when
she
working
and
obvious
that
the
Fulcrum
she
ringed
though
only
two
three
rings
She
can
shift
boulder
not
pebble
And
yet
She
can
somehow
lure
every
rogga
hundred
mile
radius
Castrima
And
yet
there
whatever
she
did
Cutter
And
yet
there
solidity
her
stability
and
implication
strength
even
though
you
seen
nothing
explain
which
makes
you
doubt
your
Fulcrum

And

Someone
set

few
moments
later
there
are

squint

see

Strongbacks
the

who
were

makes
rectangular
shape
which
confuses
you
until
you
sess
the
sudden
sharp
force
her
orogeny
which
pierces
the
geode
wall
four
points
fascinating
You
observed
her
before
when
she
does
orogeny
but
this
the
first
time
she
tried
precise
about
something
And
completely
not
what
you
expected
She
can
shift
pebble
but
she
can
slice
out
corners
and
lines
neatly
that
the
end
result
looks
machine
carved
better
than
you
could
have
done
and
suddenly
you
realize:
Maybe
she
couldn
shift
pebble
because
who
the
rust
needs
shift
pebbles
That
the
Fulcrum
way
testing
precision
Ykka
way
simply
precise
where
practical
Maybe
she
failed
your
tests
because
they
were
the
wrong
tests
Now
she
pauses
and
you
sess
her
chand
being
extended
you
You
standing
platform
around
crystal
shaft
too
narrow
for
apartments
which
instead
harbors
storerooms
and
small
tool
shop
recently
made
the
railing
made
wood
and
you
don
much
like
entrusting
your
life
But
you
grip
the
railing
and
close
your
eyes
anyway
and
orogenically
reach
for
the
connection
that
she
offers
She
seizes
you
you
hadn
been
used
this
from
Alabaster
you
would
have
panicked
but
the
same
what
happened
back
then:
Ykka
orogeny
sort
melds
with
and
consumes
yours
You
relax
and
let
her
take
control
because
instantly
you
realize
you
are
stronger
than
her
and
could
should
take
control
yourself
but
you
are
the
learner
here
and
she
the
teacher
you
hold
back
learn
dance
sorts
Her
orogeny
like
river
with
eddies
curling
and
flowing
patterns
and
pace
Yours
faster
deeper
more
straightforward
more
forceful
but
she
modulates
you
efficiently
that
the
two
flows
come
together
You
flow
slower
and
more
loosely
She
flows
faster
using
your
depth
boost
her
force
For
instant
you
open
your
eyes
see
her
leaning
against
the
crystal
column
and
sliding
down
crouch
its
base
that
she
doesn
have
pay
attention
her
body
while
she
concentrates
and
then
you
are
within
the
geode
crystal
substrate
through
its
shell
and
burrowing
into
the
rock
that
surrounds
flowing
around
the
warps
and
wends
ancient
cold
stone
Flowing
with
Ykka
easily
that
you
are
surprised
Alabaster
was
rougher
than
this
but
maybe
wasn
used
doing
when
first
tried
with
you
Ykka
has
done
this
with
others
and
she
fine
teacher
any
you
have
ever
had
But
But
You
see
easily
now
Magic
There
are
threads
interwoven
with
Ykka
flow
Supporting
and
catalyzing
her
drive
where
weaker
than
yours
soothing
the
layer
contact
between
you
Where
all
this
coming
from
She
drags
out
the
rock
itself
which
another
wonder
because
you
have
not
realized
until
now
that
there
any
magic
the
rock
But
there
flitting
between
the
infinitesimal
particles
silicon
and
calcite
easily
did
between
the
particles
Alabaster
stone
substance
Wait
Between
the
calcite
and
the
calcite
specifically
though
touches
the
silicon
being
generated
the
calcite
which
exists
limestone
inclusions
within
the
stone
some
point
millions
billions
years
ago
you
suspect
this
whole
area
was
the
bottom
ocean
perhaps
inland
sea
Generations
sea
life
were
born
and
lived
and
died
here
then
settled
that
ocean
floor
forming
layers
and
compacting
Are
those
glacier
scrapings
that
you
see
Hard
tell
You
not
geomest
But
what
you
suddenly
understand
this:
Magic
derives
from
life
that
which
alive
was
alive
even
that
which
was
alive
many
ages
ago
that
has
turned
into
something
else
All
once
this
understanding
causes
something
shift
your
perception
and
and
and
You
see
suddenly:
the
network
web
silver
threads
interlacing
the
land
permeating
rock
and
even
the
magma
just
underneath
strung
like
jewels
between
forests
and
fossilized
corals
and
pools
oil
Carried
through
the
air
the
webs
leaping
spiderlings
Threads
the
clouds
though
thin
strung
between
microscopic
living
things
water
droplets
Threads
high
your
perception
can
reach
brushing
against
the
very
stars
And
where
they
touch
the
obelisks
the
threads
become
another
thing
entirely
For
the
obelisks
that
float
against
the
map
your
awareness
which
has
suddenly
become
vast
miles
and
miles
you
are
perceiving
with
far
more
than
your
sessapinae
now
each
hovers
the
nexus
thousands
millions
trillions
threads
This
the
power
holding
them
Each
blazes
silvery
white
flickering
pulses
Evil
Earth
this
what
the
obelisks
are
when
they
aren
real
They
float
and
they
flicker
solid
magic
solid
again
and
another
plane
existence
you
inhale
awe
the
beauty
them
And
then
you
inhale
again
you
notice
close
Ykka
control
tugs
you
and
belatedly
you
realize
she
has
used
your
power
even
you
meandered
through
epiphany
Now
there
new
tunnel
slanting
through
the
layers
sedimentary
and
igneous
rock
Within
staircase
broad
shallow
steps
straight
except
for
wide
regular
landings
Nothing
has
been
excavated
make
room
for
these
stairs
instead
Ykka
has
simply
deformed
the
rock
away
pressing
into
the
walls
and
compressing
down
form
the
stairs
and
using
the
increased
density
stabilize
the
tunnel
against
the
weight
the
rock
around
But
she
has
stopped
the
tunnel
just
shy
breaching
the
surface
and
now
she
unweaves
you
from
the
network
(that
word
again
You
blink
and
turn
her
understanding
why
once
cYou
can

Ykka
says
She
getting
from
the
platform
dusting
off
her
butt
Already
she
looks
weary
must
have
tired
her
trying
modulate
your
surprised
fluctuations
She
cannot

thing
she
has
chosen
She
burn
out
before
she
made

around
the

And
she
doesn

cNo

Ykka
rubs
her

cEssie
You
smile
For
once
the
nickname
doesn
bother
you
And
then
you
use
what
you
just
learned
from
her
grabbing
her
the
way
Alabaster
once
did
grabbing
all
the
other
roggas
the
comm
too
(There
collective
flinch

They
used

Ykka
but
they
know

sess
You
have
not
earned
their
trust
she
has
Ykka
stiffens
but
you
don
anything
just
hold
her
and
now
obvious:
You
really
can
Then
you
drive
the
point
home
connecting
the
spinel
behind
you
but
you
sess
the
instant
that
stops
flickering
and
instead
sends
forth
silent
earth
shivering
pulse
Ready
you
think
saying
speaks
Ykka
eyes
widen
suddenly
she
sesses
just
how
the
obelisk
catalysis
charges
awakens
awakens
the
network
roggas
That
because
you
now
doing
the
thing
that
Alabaster
tried
teach
you
for
six
months:
using
orogeny
and
magic
together
way
that
supports
and
strengthens
each
making
stronger
whole
Then
integrating
this
into
network
orogenes
working
toward
single
goal
all
them
together
stronger
than
they
are
individually
and
plugged
into
obelisk
that
amplifies
their
power
manifold
amazing
Alabaster
failed
teach
you
because
was
like
you
Fulcrum

and
Fulcrum

taught
only
think

and
equations
and
geometric
shapes
mastered
magic
because
who
was
but
did
not
truly
understand
Neither
you
even
now
Ykka
feral
that
she
with
nothing
unlearn
was
the
key
all
along
you
hadn
been
arrogant
Well
You
cannot

Alabaster

the
instant
used
the
Obelisk

The
burns
were

already
that

Eventually
you

that
Ykka
blinks
and
frowns
cYou
okay
She
knows
the
magic

tastes
your

You
swallow

But
you
pretty
sure
that

now
There
more
than
enough
power
the
orogene
network
and
the
spinel
You
make
Castrima
safe
for
stills
and
roggas
and
anything
else
that
your

except
your
enemies
With
that
you
turn
and
raise
your

stretch
forth
You
perceive
Castrima:
over

Now

You

Obvious

More

Very

that
wonder
the
wooden
platform
hasn
collapsed
already
His
pose
has
changed
again
now
that
the
other
stone
eater
just
chunks
scattered
around
him
now
has
moved
place
one
hand
the
crystal
wall
though
the
rest
him
facing
you
His
other
hand
extends
toward
you
open
with
invitation
You
remember
day
riverside
after
Hoa
fell
into
the
mud
You
offered
him
hand
help
him
not
realizing
weighed
diamond
bones
and
ancient
tales
untold
refused
you
keep
his
secret
and
you
were
hurt
though
you
tried
not
Now
his
hand
cool
compared
the
warmth
Castrima
Solid
although
does
not
sess
quite
stone
you
realize
fleeting
fascination
There
strange
texture
his
flesh
very
slight
yielding
the
pressure
your
fingers
has
fingerprints
That
surprises
you
Then
you
look
his
face
reshaped
his
expression
from
the
coldness
that
you
saw
when
destroyed
his
enemy
Now
there
slight
smile
his
lips
cOf
course
help
you
says
much
the
boy
still
him
that
you
almost
smile
back
There
isn
time
parse
this
further
because
all
once
Castrima
blurs
into
whiteness
around
you
and
then
there
darkness
earthen
black
Hoa
hand
yours
however
you
not
panic
Then
you
stand
before
the
pavilion
Castrima
over
amid
the
dead
and
dying
Around
you
the
walkways
and
pavilion
flagstones
lie
the
soldiers
Rennanis
their
bodies
twisted
some
them
impossible
see
beneath
carpets
insects
very
few
them
still
crawling
and
screaming
The
table
that
Danel
used
plan
the
attack
overturned
nearby
beetles
crawl
over
its
surface
There
that
smell
again
meat
brine
The
air
swirls
with
boilbugs
and
the
low
pressure
breeze
you
created
One
the
bugs
darts
toward
you
and
you
cringe
instant
later
Hoa
hand
where
the
bug
was
dripping
hot
water
the
teakettle
whistle
the
crushed
creature
fizzles
away
cYou
should
probably
raise
torus
advises
Flaking
rust
yes
You
begin
pull
away
from
him
you
can
this
safely
but
his
hand
tightens
your
own
just
little
cOrogeny
can
hurt
You
have
more
power
your
disposal
than
just
orogeny
but
knows
that
all
right
then
You
raise
high
tight
torus
around
yourself
swirling
with
snow
from
the
humidity
and
immediately
the
boilbugs
begin
avoiding
you
Perhaps
they
track
prey
body
heat
all
irrelevant
You
look
then
the
blackness
that
blots
out
the
sky
The
onyx
like
obelisk
you
ever
seen
Most
are
shards
double
pointed
hexagonal
octagonal
columns
though
you
seen
few
that
were
irregular
rough
ended
This
one
ovoid
cabochon
your
summons
descending
slowly
through
the
cloud
layer
that
has
hidden
since
its
arrival
few
weeks
before
You
can
guess
its
dimensions
but
when
you
turn
your
head
take
the
bowl
Castrima
over
sky
the
onyx
nearly
fills
south
north
gray
clouded
horizon
underlit
red
reflects
nothing
and
does
not
shine
When
you
look
into
this
surprisingly
hard
without
cringing
only
scuds
cloud
around
its
edges
tell
you
that
actually
hovering
high
above
Castrima
Looking
feels
closer
Right
above
you
You
have
but
lift
your
hand
but
some
part
you
terrified
doing
this
There
strata
shaking
thud
the
spinel
drops
the
ground
behind
you
supplication
this
greater
thing
perhaps
only
that
with
the
onyx
here
and
pulling
you
drawing
you
drawing
you
Earth
draws
you
fast
there
nothing
left
you
that
can
command
any
other
obelisk
You
got
nothing
spare
You
are
falling
flying
into
void
that
does
not
much
rush
you
along
suck
you
You
have
learned
from
other
obelisks
submit
their
current
but
once
you
know
better
than
that
here
The
onyx
will
swallow
you
whole
But
you
cannot
fight
either
will
rip
you
apart
The
best
you
can
manage
kind
precarious
equilibrium
which
you
pull
against
yet
still
drift
through
its
interstices
And
too
much
you
already
much
You
need
use
this
power
but
something
wrong
something
slipping
out
equilibrium
suddenly
there
light
lashing
around
you
and
you
realize
you
are
tangled
trillion
quintillion
threads
magic
and
they
are
tightening
another
plane
existence
you
scream
This
was
mistake
eating
you
and
awful
Alabaster
was
wrong
Better
let
the
stone
eaters
kill
every
rogga
Castrima
and
destroy
the
comm
than
die
like
this
Better
let
Hoa
chew
you
pieces
with
his
beautiful
teeth
least
you
like
him
love
him
Whiplash
tightening
magic
thousand
directions
Light
lattice
blazing
alive
suddenly
against
the
black
You
see
This
far
past
your
normal
range
that
nearly
incomprehensible
You
see
the
Stillness
the
whole
You
perceive
the
half
shell
this
side
the
planet
taste
whiffs
the
other
side
too
much
and
fire
under
Earth
you
fool
Alabaster
told
you:
first
network
then
the
Gate
You
cannot
this
alone
you
need
smaller
network
buffer
the
greater
You
fumble
toward
the
orogenes
Castrima
again
but
you
cannot
grasp
them
There
are
fewer
them
now
their
numbers
flaring
and
snuffing
out
even
you
reach
and
they
are
too
panicked
for
even
you
claim
But
there
right
beside
you
small
mountain
strength:
Hoa
You
don
even
try
reach
for
him
because
that
strength
alien
and
frightening
but
reaches
for
you
Stabilizes
you
Holds
you
firm
Which
allows
you
finally
remember:
The
onyx
the
key
The
key
unlocks
gate
The
gate
activates
network
And
suddenly
the
onyx
pulses
magma
deep
and
earthen
heavy
around
you
Earth
not
network
orogenes
meant
network
The
spinel
first
right
there
The
topaz
next
its
bright
airy
power
yielding
you
easily
The
smoky
quartz
The
amethyst
your
old
friend
plodding
after
you
from
Tirimo
The
kunzite
The
jade
The
agate
The
jasper
the
opal
the
citrine
You
open
your
mouth
scream
and
not
hear
yourself
the
ruby
the
spodumene
THE
AQUAMARINE
THE
PERIDOT
THE
cIt
too
much
You
don
know
you
screaming
the
words
your
mind
out
loud
cToo
much
The
mountain
beside
you
says
cThey
need
you
Essun
And
everything
snaps
into
focus
Yes
The
Obelisk
Gate
opens
only
for
purpose
Down
Geode
walls
Flickering
columns
proto
magic
what
Castrima
made
You
sess
feel
know
the
contaminants
within
its
structure
Those
that
crawl
over
its
surfaces
you
permit
(Ykka
Penty
all
the
other
roggas
and
the
stills
who
depend
them
keep
the
comm
going
They
all
need
you
Yet
there
are
also
those
interfering
with
its
crystal
lattices
riding
along
its
strands
matter
and
magic
lurking
within
the
rock
around
the
geode
shell
like
parasites
trying
burrow
They
are
mountains
too
But
they
are
not
your
mountain
Pissed
off
the
wrong
rogga
Hoa
said
his
own
incarceration
Yes
these
enemy
stone
eaters
rusting
did
You
shout
again
but
this
time
effort
aggression
SNAP
and
you
break
lattices
and
magic
strands
and
reseal
them
your
own
design
CRACK
and
you
lift
whole
crystal
shafts
throw
them
like
spears
and
grind
your
enemies
beneath
You
look
for
Gray
Man
the
stone
eater
who
hurt
Hoa
but
not
among
the
mountains
that
threaten
your
home
These
are
just
his
minions
Fine
You
send
him
message
then
written
their
fear
the
time
you
done
you
sealed
least
five
the
enemy
stone
eaters
into
crystals
Easy
really
when
they
are
foolish
try
transit
through
them
while
you
watching
They
phase
into
the
crystal
you
simply
phase
them
freezing
them
like
bugs
amber
The
rest
are
fleeing
Some
flee
north
Unacceptable
and
distance
nothing
for
you
now
You
pull
and
wheel
and
pierce
down
again
and
there
Rennanis
nestled
within
its
lattice
nodes
like
spider
among
its
bundled
sucked
dry
prey
The
Gate
meant
things
planetary
scale
nothing
you
drive
power
down
and
inflict
upon
every
citizen
Rennanis
the
same
thing
you
did
the
woman
who
would
beaten
Penty
death
Bullies
are
bullies
simple
twist
the
flickering
silver
between
their
cells
until
those
cells
grow
still
solid
Stone
done
and
Castrima
war
won
the
breath
Now
dangerous
Now
you
understand:
wield
the
power
this
network
obelisks
without
focus
become
its
focus
and
die
The
wise
thing
now
that
Castrima
safe
would
dismantle
the
Gate
and
withdraw
from
the
connection
before
destroys
you
But
There
are
other
things
you
want
besides
Castrima
safety
The
Gate
like
orogeny
you
see
Without
conscious
control
responds
all
desires
they
are
the
desire
destroy
the
world
And
you
will
not
control
this
You
cannot
This
desire
quintessential
you
your
past
your
defensive
personality
your
many
times
broken
heart
Nassun
Your
awareness
spins
South
Tracking
Nassun
Interference
hurts
The
pearl
the
diamond
the
Sapphire
resists
being
pulled
into
the
network
the
Gate
You
barely
noticed
before
overwhelmed
you
were
dozens
hundreds
obelisks
but
you
notice
now
because
NASSUN
HER
your
daughter
Nassun
you
know
the
stolid
complexity
her
you
know
your
own
heart
and
soul
her
written
all
over
this
obelisk
and
you
have
found
her
she
alive
Its
(your
goal
accomplished
the
Gate
automatically
begins
disengage
The
other
obelisks
disconnect
the
onyx
releases
you
last
albeit
with
whiff
cold
reluctance
Next
time
And
your
body
sags
and
lists
one
side
because
something
suddenly
throws
off
your
balance
hands
take
hold
you
and
pull
you
upright
You
can
barely
lift
your
head
Your
body
feels
distant
heavy
like
the
sensation
being
stone
You
have
not
eaten
hours
but
you
feel
hunger
You
know
you
been
taxed
far
beyond
your
own
endurance
but
you
feel
exhaustion
There
are
mountains
around
you
cRest
Essun
says
the
one
you
love
take
care
you
You
nod
with
head
heavy
boulder
Then
new
presences
pull
your
attention
and
you
force
yourself
look
one
last
time
Antimony
stands
before
you
impassive
ever
but
there
something
comforting
about
her
presence
nevertheless
You
know
instinctively
that
she
enemy
Beside
her
stands
another
stone
eater:
tall
slender
somehow
awkward
its
draped
cclothing
Allover
white
though
the
shape
its
facial
features
Eastern
Coaster:
full
mouth
and
long
nose
high
cheekbones
and
sculpture
neatly
sculpted
kinky
hair
Only
its
eyes
are
black
and
though
they
watch
you
with
only
faint
recognition
with
puzzled
flicker
something
that
might
(but
should
not
memory
something
about
those
eyes
familiar
How
ironic
This
the
first
time
you
ever
seen
stone
eater
made
alabaster
And
then
you
are
gone
