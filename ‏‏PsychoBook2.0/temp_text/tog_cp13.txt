BEGINS
FEEL
though
you
lived
Castrima
all
your
life
shouldn
Just
another
comm
just
another
name
just
another
new
start
least
partial
one
will
probably
end
the
way
all
the
others
have
But
makes
difference
that
here
everyone
knows
what
you
are
That
the
one
good
thing
about
the
Fulcrum
about
Meov
about
being
Syenite:
You
could
who
you
were
That
luxury
you
learning
savor
anew
You
topside
again
Castrima
over
they
been
calling
standing
what
used
the
town
token
greenland
The
ground
around
Castrima
alkaline
and
sandy
you
heard
Ykka
actually
hoping
for
little
acid
rain
make
the
soil
better
You
think
the
ground
probably
needs
more
organic
matter
for
that
work
and
there
isn
likely
much
that
since
you
saw
three
boilbug
mounds
the
way
here
The
good
news
that
the
mounds
are
easy
detect
even
when
they
only
little
higher
than
the
ash
layer
that
covers
the
ground
The
insects
within
them
tickle
your
awareness
ready
source
heat
and
pressure
for
your
orogeny
the
walk
here
you
showed
the
children
how
sess
for
that
pent
difference
from
the
cooler
more
relaxed
ambient
around
The
younger
ones
made
game
gasping
and
pointing
whenever
they
sensed
mound
and
trying
outdo
one
another
the
count
The
bad
news
that
there
are
more
the
boilbug
mounds
this
week
than
there
were
last
week
That
probably
not
good
thing
but
you
don
let
the
children
see
your
worry
There
are
seventeen
children
altogether
the
bulk
Castrima
complement
orogenes
couple
are
the
teen
range
but
most
are
younger
one
only
five
Most
are
orphans
might
well
and
that
does
not
surprise
you
all
What
does
surprise
you
that
all
them
must
have
relatively
good
self
control
and
quick
wits
because
otherwise
they
wouldn
have
survived
the
Rifting
They
would
had
sess
coming
time
enough
get
someplace
isolated
let
their
instincts
save
them
recover
and
then
someplace
else
before
anybody
started
trying
figure
out
who
was
the
center
the
circle
non
destruction
Most
are
Midlatter
mongrels
like
you:
lots
not
quite
Sanzed
bronze
skin
not
quite
ashblow
hair
eyes
and
bodies
continuum
from
the
Arctic
the
Coaster
Not
much
different
from
the
kids
you
used
teach
Tirimo
creche
Only
the
subject
matter
and
necessity
your
teaching
methods
must
different
cSess
what
just
sess
don
imitate
yet
you
say
and
then
you
construct
torus
around
yourself
You
several
times
each
time
different
way
sometimes
spinning
high
and
tight
sometimes
holding
steady
but
wide
enough
that
its
edge
rolls
close
them
(Half
the
children
gasp
and
scramble
away
That
exactly
what
they
should
good
Not
good
that
the
rest
just
stood
there
stupidly
You
have
work
that
cNow
Spread
out
You
there
you
there
all
you
stay
about
that
far
apart
Once
you
place
spin
torus
that
looks
exactly
like
the
one
making
now
isn
how
the
Fulcrum
would
taught
them
There
with
years
time
and
safe
walls
and
comforting
blue
skies
overhead
the
teaching
could
done
gently
gradually
giving
the
children
time
get
over
their
fears
outgrow
their
immaturities
There
time
for
gentleness
Season
though
and
room
for
failure
within
Castrima
jagged
walls
You
heard
the
grumbling
seen
the
resentful
looks
when
you
join
use
caste
crews
head
down
the
communal
bath
Ykka
thinks
Castrima
something
special:
comm
where
rogga
and
still
can
live
harmony
working
together
survive
You
think
she
naive
These
children
need
prepared
for
the
inevitable
day
that
Castrima
turns
them
you
demonstrate
and
correct
their
imitations
with
words
when
you
can
and
once
with
torus
inversion
slap
when
one
the
older
children
spins
his
too
wide
and
threatens
ice
one
his
comrades
cYou
cannot
careless
The
boy
sits
the
icy
ground
staring
you
wide
eyed
You
also
made
the
ground
heave
under
his
feet
throw
him
down
and
you
standing
over
him
now
shouting
deliberately
intimidating
almost
killed
another
child
should
afraid
cPeople
die
when
you
make
mistakes
that
what
you
want
frantic
headshake
cThen
get
and
again
You
flog
them
through
the
exercise
until
every
one
them
has
demonstrated
least
basic
ability
control
the
size
their
torus
feels
wrong
teach
them
only
this
without
any
the
theory
that
will
help
them
understand
why
and
how
their
power
works
any
the
stabilizing
exercises
designed
perfect
the
detachment
instinct
from
power
You
must
teach
them
days
what
you
mastered
over
years
where
you
are
artist
they
will
only
crude
imitators
best
They
are
subdued
when
you
walk
them
back
Castrima
and
you
suspect
some
them
hate
you
Actually
you
pretty
sure
they
hate
you
But
they
will
more
useful
Castrima
like
this
and
the
inevitable
day
that
Castrima
turns
them
they
ready
(This
familiar
series
thoughts
Once
you
trained
Nassun
you
told
yourself
that
did
not
matter
she
hated
you
the
end
she
would
know
your
love
her
own
survival
That
never
felt
right
though
did
You
were
gentler
with
Uche
for
that
reason
And
you
always
meant
apologize
Nassun
later
when
she
was
old
enough
understand
there
are
many
regrets
you
that
they
spin
heavy
compressed
iron
your
core
cYou
right
Alabaster
says
you
sit
infirmary
cot
and
tell
him
about
the
lesson
later
cBut
you
also
wrong
later
than
usual
for
you
visiting
Alabaster
and
result
restless
and
visible
pain
amid
his
nest
The
medications
that
Lerna
usually
gives
him
are
wearing
off
Being
with
him
always
competition
desires
for
you:
You
know
there
not
much
time
for
him
teach
you
this
stuff
but
you
also
want
prolong
his
life
and
every
day
that
you
wear
him
down
grates
you
like
glacier
Urgency
and
despair
don
get
along
well
You
resolved
keep
brief
this
time
but
seems
inclined
talk
lot
today
leans
against
Antimony
hand
and
keeps
his
eyes
closed
You
can
help
thinking
this
some
kind
strength
saving
gesture
just
the
sight
you
drain
cWrong
you
prompt
Maybe
there
warning
note
your
voice
You
always
been
protective
your
students
whoever
they
are
cFor
wasting
your
time
for
one
thing
They
never
have
the
precision
more
than
rock
pushers
Alabaster
voice
thick
with
contempt
cInnon
was
rock
pusher
you
snap
muscle
flexes
his
jaw
and
pauses
for
moment
cSo
maybe
good
thing
that
you
teaching
them
how
push
rocks
safely
even
you
aren
doing
kindly
Now
the
contempt
gone
from
his
words
close
apology
you
probably
going
get
from
him
cBut
stand
the
rest:
You
wrong
teach
them
all
because
their
lessons
are
getting
the
way
your
lessons
cWhat
makes
you
sess
one
his
stumps
again
and
Ohhhh
Suddenly
harder
grasp
the
stuff
between
his
cells
takes
longer
for
your
perception
adjust
and
when
does
you
keep
having
reflexively
jerk
yourself
out
tendency
notice
only
the
heat
and
jittering
movement
the
small
particles
One
afternoon
teaching
has
set
your
learning
back
week
more
cThere
reason
the
Fulcrum
taught
you
the
way
did
explains
finally
when
you
sit
back
and
rub
your
eyes
and
fight
down
frustration
opened
his
eyes
now
they
are
hooded
they
watch
you
cThe
Fulcrum
methods
are
kind
conditioning
meant
steer
you
toward
energy
redistribution
and
away
from
magic
The
torus
isn
even
necessary
you
can
gather
ambient
energy
any
number
ways
But
that
how
they
teach
you
direct
your
awareness
down
perform
orogeny
never
Nothing
above
you
matters
Only
your
immediate
surroundings
never
farther
shakes
his
head
the
degree
that
can
cIt
amazing
when
you
think
about
Everyone
the
Stillness
like
this
Never
mind
what
the
oceans
never
mind
what
the
sky
never
look
your
own
horizon
and
wonder
what
beyond
spent
centuries
making
fun
the
astronomests
for
their
crackpot
theories
but
what
really
found
incredible
was
that
they
ever
bothered
look
formulate
them
You
almost
forgotten
this
part
him:
the
dreamer
the
rebel
always
reconsidering
the
way
things
have
always
been
because
maybe
they
should
never
have
been
that
way
the
first
place
right
too
Life
the
Stillness
discourages
reconsideration
reorientation
Wisdom
set
stone
after
all
that
why
one
trusts
the
mutability
metal
There
reason
Alabaster
was
the
magnetic
core
your
little
family
back
when
you
were
together
Damn
you
nostalgic
today
prompts
you
say
think
you
not
just
ten
ringer
blinks
surprise
cYou
always
thinking
You
genius
too
just
that
your
genius
subject
area
that
one
respects
Alabaster
stares
you
for
moment
His
eyes
narrow
cAre
you
drunk
cNo
not
Evil
Earth
much
for
your
fond
memories
cGo
with
the
rusting
lesson
seems
more
relieved
the
change
subject
than
you
cSo
that
what
Fulcrum
training
does
you
You
learn
think
orogeny
matter
effort
when
really
perspective
And
perception
Allia
shaped
trauma
tells
you
why
the
Fulcrum
wouldn
have
wanted
every
two
shard
feral
reaching
for
any
obelisks
nearby
But
you
spend
moment
trying
understand
the
distinction
explaining
true
that
using
energy
something
entirely
different
from
using
magic
The
Fulcrum
method
makes
orogeny
feel
like
what
is:
straining
shove
around
heavy
objects
just
with
will
instead
hands
levers
Magic
though
feels
effortless
least
while
one
using
The
exhaustion
comes
later
the
moment
though
simply
about
knowing
there
Training
yourself
see
don
understand
why
they
did
this
you
say
tapping
your
fingers
the
mattress
thought
The
Fulcrum
was
built
orogenes
least
some
them
some
point
the
past
must
have
sessed
magic
But
you
shiver
you
understand
yes
The
most
powerful
orogenes
the
ones
who
detect
magic
most
easily
and
perhaps
have
trouble
mastering
energy
redistribution
result
are
the
ones
who
end
the
nodes
Alabaster
thinks
bigger
pictures
than
just
the
Fulcrum
think
says
cthey
understood
the
danger
Not
just
that
roggas
who
lacked
the
necessary
fine
control
would
connect
obelisks
and
die
but
that
some
might
successfully
for
the
wrong
reasons
You
try
think
right
reason
activate
network
ancient
death
machines
Alabaster
reads
your
face
doubt
the
first
rogga
who
wanted
tip
the
Fulcrum
into
lava
pit
cGood
point
cAnd
the
war
Don
ever
forget
that
The
Guardians
who
work
with
the
Fulcrum
are
one
the
factions
told
you
about
speak
They
the
ones
who
want
the
status
quo:
roggas
made
safe
and
useful
stills
doing
all
the
work
and
thinking
they
run
the
place
Guardians
actually
charge
everything
Controlling
the
people
who
can
control
natural
disasters
You
surprised
this
you
surprised
you
didn
think
yourself
But
then
you
haven
spent
much
time
thinking
about
Guardians
when
you
weren
the
immediate
vicinity
one
Maybe
this
another
kind
thought
aversion
you
been
conditioned
to:
Don
look
and
don
think
about
those
damned
smiles
You
decide
make
yourself
think
about
them
now
cBut
Guardians
die
during
Season
Shit
cThey
say
they
die
Shit
cOf
course
they
don
Alabaster
lets
out
rusty
sound
that
might
laugh
bad
influence
always
has
been
You
can
help
smiling
though
the
feeling
doesn
last
because
the
conversation
cThey
don
join
comms
though
They
must
somewhere
else
ride
out
cMaybe
Maybe
this
Warrant
place
one
seems
know
where
pauses
grows
thoughtful
suppose
should
have
asked
mine
about
that
before
left
her
one
just
leaves
their
Guardian
cYou
said
you
didn
kill
her
blinks
out
memory
cNo
cured
her
Sort
You
know
about
the
thing
their
heads
Yes
Blood
and
the
sting
your
palm
Schaffa
handing
something
tiny
and
bloody
another
Guardian
with
great
care
You
nod
cIt
gives
them
their
abilities
but
also
taints
them
twists
them
The
seniors
the
Fulcrum
used
speak
whispers
There
are
degrees
contamination
sets
his
jaw
visibly
steering
himself
away
from
that
topic
You
can
guess
why
Somewhere
along
the
way
lands
the
shirtless
Guardians
who
kill
with
touch
cAnyway
took
that
thing
out
mine
You
swallow
saw
Guardian
kill
another
once
taking
out
cYes
When
the
contamination
becomes
too
great
Then
they
dangerous
even
other
Guardians
and
must
purged
heard
they
weren
gentle
about
Brutes
even
their
own
angry
Guardian
Timay
had
said
right
before
Schaffa
killed
her
Readying
for
the
time
return
You
inhale
The
memory
vivid
your
mind
because
that
was
the
day
that
you
and
Tonkee
Binof
found
the
socket
The
day
your
first
ring
test
early
and
with
your
life
the
balance
You
never
forget
anything
that
day
And
now
cIt
the
Earth
cWhat
cThe
thing
that
Guardians
The
contaminant
changed
those
who
would
control
Chained
them
fate
fate
cShe
started
speaking
for
the
Earth
You
can
tell
you
actually
surprised
him
for
once
cThen
considers
for
moment
see
That
when
they
switch
teams
Stop
working
for
the
status
quo
and
Guardian
interests
and
start
working
for
the
Earth
interests
instead
wonder
the
others
kill
them
This
what
you
need
understand
cWhat
does
the
Earth
want
Alabaster
gaze
heavy
heavy
cWhat
does
any
living
thing
want
facing
enemy
cruel
that
stole
away
child
Your
jaw
tightens
Vengeance
You
shift
down
from
the
cot
the
floor
leaning
against
the
cot
frame
cTell
about
the
Obelisk
Gate
cYes
thought
that
would
get
you
interested
Alabaster
voice
has
gone
soft
again
but
there
look
his
face
that
makes
you
think
This
what
looked
like
the
day
made
the
Rift
cYou
remember
the
basic
principle
Parallel
scaling
Yoking
two
oxen
together
instead
one
Two
roggas
together
can
more
than
each
individually
works
for
obelisks
too
just
exponential
matrix
not
yoke
Dynamic
Okay
you
following
far
cSo
need
figure
out
how
chain
all
them
together
nods
back
minutely
cAnd
you
need
buffer
least
initially
When
opened
the
Gate
Yumenes
used
several
dozen
node
maintainers
Several
dozen
stunted
twisted
roggas
turned
into
mindless
weapons
and
Alabaster
somehow
turned
them
against
their
owners
How
like
him
and
how
perfect
cBuffer
cTo
cushion
the
impact
smooth
out
the
connection
flow
falters
sighs
don
know
how
explain
You
know
when
you
try
When
assumes
much
cWhat
you
did
killed
the
node
maintainers
cNot
precisely
used
them
open
the
Gate
and
create
the
Rift
and
then
they
tried
what
they
were
made
do:
Stop
the
shake
Stabilize
the
land
You
grimace
understanding
Even
you
your
extremity
weren
foolish
enough
try
stop
the
shockwave
when
reached
Tirimo
The
only
safe
thing
was
divert
its
force
elsewhere
But
node
maintainers
lack
the
mind
control
the
safe
thing
didn
use
all
them
Alabaster
says
thoughtfully
cThe
ones
far
the
west
and
the
Arctics
and
Antarctics
were
out
reach
Most
have
died
since
one
keep
them
alive
But
can
still
sess
active
nodes
few
places
Remnants
the
network:
south
near
the
Antarctic
Fulcrum
and
north
near
Rennanis
course
can
sess
active
nodes
all
the
way
the
Antarctics
You
can
barely
sess
hundred
miles
from
Castrima
and
you
have
work
stretch
that
far
And
maybe
the
roggas
the
Antarctic
Fulcrum
have
survived
somehow
and
chosen
care
for
their
less
fortunate
brethren
the
nodes
but
cRennanis
That
can
Equatorial
city
More
southerly
and
westerly
than
most
people
Yumenes
thought
was
only
step
above
any
other
Somidlats
backwater
But
Rennanis
was
Equatorial
enough
that
should
gone
cThe
Rift
wends
northwesterly
along
ancient
fault
line
that
found
swung
few
hundred
miles
wide
Rennanis
suppose
that
was
enough
let
the
node
maintainers
actually
something
Should
killed
most
them
and
the
rest
should
died
neglect
when
their
staffs
abandoned
them
but
don
know
falls
silent
perhaps
weary
His
voice
hoarse
today
and
his
eyes
are
bloodshot
Another
infection
keeps
getting
them
because
some
the
burned
patches
his
body
aren
healing
Lerna
says
The
lack
pain
meds
isn
helping
You
try
digest
what
told
you
what
Antimony
has
told
you
what
you
learned
through
trial
and
suffering
Maybe
the
numbers
matter
Two
hundred
and
sixteen
obelisks
some
incalculable
number
other

and
you
Magic
tie
the
three
together

All
together

Earthfires

Moon
Alabaster
says
nothing
while
you
ponder
and
eventually
you
glance
him
see
fallen
asleep
But
awake
his
eyes
slits
watching
you
cWhat
You
frown
defensive
always
quarter
smiles
with
the
half

hasn
been
burned

never

die
don
say
rusting
word
you
work
miracles
for
sighs
cEvil
Earth
how
missed
you
This
hurts
unexpectedly
You
realize
why
once:
because
been
long
since
anyone
said
anything
like
this
you
Jija
could
affectionate
but
wasn
much
given
sentimentality
Innon
used
sex
and
jokes
show
his
tenderness
But
Alabaster
this
has
always
been
his
way
The
surprise
gesture
the
backhanded
compliment
that
you
could
choose
take
for
teasing
insult
You
hardened
much
without
this
Without
him
You
seem
strong
healthy
but
inside
you
feel
like
looks:
nothing
but
brittle
stone
and
scars
prone
cracking
you
bend
too
much
You
try
smile
and
fail
doesn
try
You
just
look
each
other
nothing
and
everything
once
course
doesn
last
Someone
walks
into
the
infirmary
and
comes
over
and
surprises
you
being
Ykka
Hjarka
behind
her
slouching
along
and
looking
very
Sanzedly
bored:
picking
her
sharp
filed
teeth
with
bit
polished
wood
one
hand
her
well
curved
hip
her
ashblow
hair
worse
mess
than
usual
and
noticeably
flatter
one
side
where
she
just
woken
cSorry
interrupt
Ykka
says
not
sounding
especially
sorry
cbut
got
problem
You
beginning
hate
those
words
Still
time
end
the
lesson
you
nod
Alabaster
and
get
cWhat
now
cYour
friend
The
slacker
Tonkee
who
hasn
joined
the
Innovators
work
crews
doesn
bother
pick
your
household
share
when
her
turn
and
who
conveniently
disappears
whenever
time
for
caste
meeting
another
comm
they
have
already
kicked
her
out
for
that
kind
thing
but
she
gets
extra
leeway
for
being
one
the
companions
the
second
most
powerful
orogene
Castrima
only
goes
far
though
and
Ykka
looks
especially
pissed
off
cShe
found
the
control
room
Ykka
says
cLocked
herself
inside
cThe
What
cThe
control
room
for
what
Castrima
Ykka
looks
annoyed
have
explain
told
you
when
you
got
here:
There
are
mechanisms
that
make
this
place
function
the
light
and
the
air
and
keep
the
room
secret
because
somebody
loses
and
wants
smash
things
they
could
kill
all
But
your
mest
there
doing
Evil
Earth
knows
what
and
basically
asking
you
okay
kill
her
because
that
about
where
right
now
cShe
won
able
affect
anything
important
Alabaster
says
startles
you
both
you
because
you
aren
used
seeing
him
interact
with
anyone
else
and
Ykka
because
she
probably
thinks
him
waste
medicines
and
not
person
doesn
think
much
her
either
his
eyes
are
closed
again
cMore
likely
hurt
herself
than
anything
else
cGood
know
Ykka
says
though
she
looks
him
skeptically
reassured
you
weren
talking
out
your
ass
seeing
you
couldn
possibly
know
what
happening
beyond
this
infirmary
but
nice
thought
anyway
lets
out
soft
snort
amusement
knew
everything
needed
know
about
this
relic
the
instant
came
here
And
any
you
other
than
Essun
had
chance
making
what
really
capable
wouldn
stay
here
moment
longer
you
and
Ykka
stare
lets
out
heavy
sigh
There
little
bit
rattle
which
troubles
you
and
you
make
note
ask
Lerna
about
But
says
nothing
more
and
finally
Ykka
glances
you
with
palpable
really
sick
your
friends
look
and
beckons
for
you
follow
her
out
long
way
wherever
this
control
room
Hjarka
breathing
hard
after
the
first
ladder
but
she
acclimates
after
that
and
settles
into
rhythm
Ykka
does
better
though
she
still
sweating
ten
minutes
You
still
got
your
road
conditioning
you
handle
the
climb
well
enough
but
after
the
first
three
flights
stairs
ladder
and
spiraling
balcony
built
round
one
the
fatter
crystals
the
comm
you
even
willing
start
small
talk
take
your
mind
off
the
ground
falling
farther
and
farther
below
cWhat
your
usual
disciplinary
process
for
people
who
shirk
their
caste
duties
cThe
boot
what
else
Ykka
shrugs
cWe
can
just
ash
them
out
though
have
kill
them
maintain
secrecy
But
there
process:
one
warning
then
hearing
Morat
that
the
Innovator
caste
spokeswoman
hasn
made
formal
complaint
asked
her
but
she
waffled
Said
your
friend
gave
her
portable
water
testing
device
that
may
save
some
our
Hunters
lives
out
the
field
Hjarka
utters
rusty
laugh
You
shake
your
head
amused
cThat
nice
bribe
She
survivor
nothing
else
Ykka
rolls
her
eyes
cMaybe
But
sends
bad
message
one
person
not
joining
any
work
crews
and
going
unpunished
for
even
she
does
invent
useful
things
outside
work
time
Others
start
skive
off
what
then
cAsh
out
the
ones
who
haven
invented
anything
you
suggest
Then
you
stop
because
Ykka
has
paused
You
think
because
she
annoyed
what
you
just
said
but
she
looking
around
taking
the
expanse
the
comm
you
stop
too
This
far
you
well
above
the
main
inhabited
level
the
comm
The
geode
echoes
with
calls
and
someone
hammering
something
and
one
the
work
crews
singing
rhythm
song
You
risk
look
over
the
nearest
railing
and
see
that
someone
made
simple
rope
and
wooden
pallet
cargo
lift
for
the
mid
level
but
without
counterweight
the
only
way
get
heavy
load
basically
play
tug
war
with
Twenty
people
are
now
looks
surprisingly
like
fun
cYou
were
right
about
the
assimilations
Hjarka
says
Her
voice
soft
she
too
contemplates
the
bustle
and
life
Castrima
cWe
couldn
have
made
this
place
work
without
more
people
Thought
you
were
full
shit
but
you
weren
Ykka
sighs
far
working
She
eyes
Hjarka
cYou
never
said
you
didn
like
the
idea
before
Hjarka
shrugs
left
home
comm
because
didn
want
the
burden
Leadership
Didn
want
here
either
cYou
don
have
knife
fight
for
the
headwomanship
give
opinion
for
Earth
sake
cWhen
Season
coming
and
the
only
Leader
the
comm
better
careful
even
about
opinions
She
shrugs
then
smiles
Ykka
with
air
something
like
affection
cKeep
figuring
you
have
killed
any
minute
now
Ykka
laughs
once
cIs
that
what
you
would
done
place
You
hear
the
edge
this
cIt
the
playbook
was
taught
follow
yeah
but
stupid
try
that
here
There
never
been
anything
like
this
Season
this
comm
Hjarka
eyes
you
pointedly
the
latest
example
Castrima
peculiarity
cTradition
just
going
rust
everything
situation
like
this
Better
have
headwoman
who
doesn
know
how
things
should
only
how
she
wants
them
headwoman
who
kick
all
the
asses
necessary
make
her
vision
happen
Ykka
absorbs
this
silence
for
few
moments
Obviously
whatever
Tonkee
done
isn
urgent
terrible
Then
she
turns
and
begins
climbing
again
apparently
deciding
that
the
rest
break
over
You
and
Hjarka
sigh
and
follow
think
the
people
who
originally
built
this
place
didn
think
through
Ykka
says
the
climb
resumes
cToo
inefficient
Too
dependent
machinery
that
can
break
down
rust
out
And
orogeny
power
source
which
basically
the
least
reliable
thing
ever
But
then
sometimes
wonder
maybe
they
didn
intend
build
this
way
Maybe
something
drove
them
underground
fast
and
they
found
giant
geode
and
just
made
the
best
what
they
had
She
runs
hand
along
railing
you
walk
This
one
the
original
metal
structures
that
have
been
built
throughout
the
geode
Above
the
inhabited
levels
all
old
metalwork
cAlways
makes
think
they
really
must
have
been
the
ancestors
Castrima
They
respected
hard
work
and
adapting
under
pressure
like
cDoesn
everyone
Except
Tonkee
cSome
She
doesn
take
the
obvious
bait
outed
myself
everyone
when
was
fifteen
There
was
forest
fire
somewhere
the
south
drought
season
The
smoke
alone
was
killing
the
older
people
and
babies
the
comm
thought
have
leave
Finally
went
the
edge
the
fire
where
bunch
the
other
townsfolk
were
trying
create
firebreak
Six
them
died
doing
that
She
shakes
her
head
cWouldn
have
worked
The
fire
was
too
big
But
that
people
for
you
You
nod
does
sound
like
the
Castrimans
you
gotten
know
also
sounds
like
the
Tirimo
folk
you
gotten
know
and
the
Meovites
and
the
Allians
and
the
Yumenescenes
people
the
Stillness
would
have
survived
this
point
they
weren
fearsomely
tenacious
But
Ykka
needs
think
Castrima
special
and
special
its
own
strange
ways
you
wisely
keep
your
mouth
shut
She
says
stopped
the
fire
Iced
the
burning
part
the
forest
and
used
that
make
ridge
farther
south
windbreak
case
anything
set
off
new
blaze
Everyone
saw
They
knew
exactly
what
was
then
You
stop
walking
and
stare
her
She
turns
back
half
smiling
told
them
they
wanted
call
the
Guardians
and
have
shipped
off
the
Fulcrum
they
wanted
just
string
promised
not
ice
anyone
Instead
they
argued
about
the
whole
mess
for
three
days
thought
they
were
trying
decide
how
kill
She
shrugs
cSo
went
home
had
dinner
with
parents
they
both
knew
and
they
were
terrified
for
but
talked
them
down
from
smuggling
out
town
horse
cart
Went
creche
the
next
day
same
always
the
end
found
out
the
townsfolk
had
been
arguing
about
how
get
trained
Without
letting
the
Fulcrum
see
Your
mouth
falls
open
You
seen
Ykka
parents
who
are
still
hale
and
strong
and
with
air
Sanzed
stubbornness
about
them
You
can
believe
them
But
everyone
else
too
All
right
Maybe
Castrima
special
Hjarka
says
cHuh
How
did
you
get
trained
then
cEh
you
know
what
these
little
Midlatter
comms
are
like
They
were
still
arguing
about
when
the
Rifting
happened
trained
damn
self
She
laughs
and
Hjarka
sighs
cThat
people
too
Complete
rust
heads
but
good
people
You
think
against
your
will
only
had
brought
Uche
and
Nassun
here
soon
they
were
born
cNot
all
your
people
like
having
here
you
blurt
almost
rebuttal
your
own
thought
cYeah
heard
the
chatter
Which
why
glad
you
training
the
kids
and
that
everyone
saw
you
get
the
boilbugs
off
Terteis
She
sobers
cPoor
Terteis
But
you
proved
again
that
better
have
people
like
around
than
kill
drive
out
Castrimans
are
practical
people
Essie
You
hate
this
nickname
immediately
cToo
practical
just
something
because
everybody
else
says
With
that
she
resumes
the
climb
After
moment
you
and
Hjarka
too
You
gotten
used
the
unrelenting
whiteness
Castrima
only
few
the
building
crystals
have
touches
amethyst
smoky
quartz
about
them
Here
though
the
ceiling
the
geode
has
been
sealed
off
with
smooth
glasslike
substance
that
deep
emeraldine
green
color
The
color
bit
shock
The
final
stairway
that
leads
into
this
wide
enough
for
five
people
climb
abreast
you
unsurprised
find
two
Castrima
Strongbacks
flanking
what
looks
like
sliding
attic
door
made
the
same
green
substance
One
the
Strongbacks
has
small
wireglass
utility
knife
her
hand
the
other
just
has
his
big
folded
arms
cStill
nothing
says
the
male
Strongback
the
three
you
arrive
cWe
keep
hearing
sounds
from
inside
clicking
buzzing
and
sometimes
she
yells
things
But
the
door
still
jammed
cYells
things
asks
Hjarka
shrugs
cLike
knew
and
that
why
Sounds
like
Tonkee
cHow
does
she
have
the
door
rigged
you
ask
The
female
Strongback
shrugs
stereotype
that
Strongbacks
are
all
muscle
and
brain
but
few
them
fit
that
description
more
than
they
should
Ykka
gives
you
another
This
your
fault
look
You
shake
your
head
then
climb
the
top
step
and
bang
the
door
cTonkee
rust
open
There
moment
silence
and
then
you
hear
faint
clatter
cFuck
you
Tonkee
mutters
from
somewhere
farther
away
than
the
door
cHang
and
don
ice
anything
moment
later
there
the
sound
something
rattling
against
the
door
material
Then
the
door
slides
open
You
Ykka
Hjarka
and
the
Strongbacks
climb
though
all
you
except
Ykka
stop
and
stare
left
her
fold
her
arms
and
give
Tonkee
the
exasperated
glare
she
earned
The
ceiling
hollow
above
the
door
The
green
substance
forms
floor
and
the
resulting
chamber
molded
around
the
usual
white
crystals
that
jut
down
from
the
geode
rocky
grayish
green
true
ceiling
perhaps
fifteen
feet
overhead
What
makes
you
stop
your
mouth
falling
open
and
your
mind
stuttering
from
annoyance
into
silence
that
the
crystals
this
side
the
green
barrier
flicker
and
blink
transitioning
random
from
shimmering
images
crystals
into
solidity
and
back
again
The
shafts
and
tips
these
crystals
which
poke
through
the
floor
weren
doing
this
outside
None
the
other
crystals
Castrima
this
Aside
from
glowing
which
granted
warning
that
they
aren
just
rocks
the
crystals
Castrima
are
different
from
any
other
quartz
Here
though
you
suddenly
understand
what
Alabaster
meant
about
what
Castrima
capable
The
truth
Castrima
suddenly
terrifyingly
clear:
The
geode
filled
with
not
crystals
but
potential
obelisks
cFlaking
rust
one
the
Strongbacks
breathes
This
speaks
for
you
well
Tonkee
junk
everywhere
the
room:
weird
tools
and
slates
and
scraps
leather
covered
diagrams
and
pallet
the
corner
that
explains
why
she
hasn
been
sleeping
the
apartment
much
lately
(It
been
lonely
without
her
and
Hoa
but
you
don
like
admitting
this
yourself
She
walking
away
from
you
now
glaring
over
her
shoulder
and
looking
distinctly
irritated
that
you
arrived
cDon
rusting
touch
anything
she
says
cNo
telling
what
orogene
your
caliber
will
this
stuff
Ykka
rolls
her
eyes
cYou
the
one
who
shouldn
touching
anything
You
not
allowed
here
and
you
know
Come
cNo
Tonkee
crouches
near
strange
low
plinth
the
center
the
room
looks
like
crystal
shaft
whose
middle
has
been
chopped
out:
You
see
the
(flickering
unreal
base
growing
from
the
ceiling
and
the
plinth
its
(flickering
tandem
continuation
but
there
five
foot
section
between
that
just
empty
space
The
plinth
surface
has
been
cut
smoothly
that
gleams
like
mirror
and
the
surface
stays
solid
even
the
rest
the
shaft
flickers
first
you
think
there
nothing
But
Tonkee
peering
the
plinth
surface
intently
that
you
walk
over
join
her
When
you
hunker
down
for
better
look
she
glances
meet
your
eyes
and
you
shocked
the
barely
disguised
glee
hers
Not
really
shocked
that
you
know
her
now
You
shocked
because
this
high
gleam
plus
the
new
undisguise
her
clean
short
hair
and
neat
clothing
transforms
her
obviously
into
older
version
Binof
that
you
marvel
again
you
didn
see
once
But
that
unimportant
You
focus
the
plinth
even
though
there
are
other
wonders
behold:
taller
plinth
near
the
back
the
room
above
which
floats
foot
tall
miniature
obelisk
the
same
emerald
color
the
floor
another
plinth
bearing
oblong
hunk
rock
also
floating
series
clear
squares
set
into
one
wall
bearing
strange
diagrams
some
sort
equipment
series
panels
along
the
wall
beneath
them
each
bearing
meters
measuring
something
unknown
numbers
that
you
can
decipher
the
big
plinth
though
are
the
least
obtrusive
objects
the
room:
six
tiny
metallic
shards
each
needle
thin
and
longer
than
your
thumbnail
They
are
not
the
same
silvery
metal
that
makes
Castrima
ancient
structures
this
metal
smooth
dark
color
dusted
faintly
with
red
Iron
Amazing
that
hasn
oxidized
away
over
all
the
years
Castrima
existence
Unless
cDid
you
put
these
here
you
ask
Tonkee
She
instantly
furious
cYes
course
would
enter
the
control
core
deadciv
artifact
find
the
most
dangerous
device
and
immediately
throw
bits
rusty
metal
cDon
ass
please
Though
you
did
sort
deserve
that
you
too
intrigued
really
annoyed
cWhy
you
think
this
the
most
dangerous
device
here
Tonkee
points
the
beveled
edge
the
plinth
You
look
closer
and
blink
The
material
not
smooth
like
the
rest
the
crystal
shaft
the
edge
has
been
heavily
etched
with
symbols
and
writing
The
writing
the
same
that
along
the
wall
panels
And
they
are
glowing
red
the
color
seeming
float
and
waver
just
over
the
surface
the
material
cAnd
this
Tonkee
says
She
raises
hand
and
moves
toward
the
plinth
surface
and
the
metal
bits
Abruptly
the
red
letters
leap
into
the
air
you
don
have
better
way
describe
what
happening
than
that
instant
they
have
enlarged
and
turned
face
you
blazing
the
air
eye
level
with
what
unmistakably
some
sort
warning
Red
the
color
lava
pools
the
color
lake
when
everything
has
died
except
toxic
algae:
one
warning
sign
impending
blow
Some
things
not
change
with
time
culture
you
feel
certain
(You
are
wrong
generally
speaking
But
this
specific
case
you
quite
right
Everyone
staring
Hjarka
comes
close
and
lifts
hand
try
touch
the
floating
letters
her
fingers
pass
through
them
Ykka
moves
around
the
plinth
fascinated
despite
herself
noticed
this
thing
before
but
never
really
paid
attention
The

Impatiently
Tonkee
pulls

out

You
reach
toward

ignoring
the

this

when

Tonkee
hisses
you
sharply
that
you
jerk
back

caught
doing

long
have
you
been
coming
here
Ykka
crouched
next
Tonkee
sleeping
pallet
Tonkee
staring
down
the
iron
bits
and
first
you
think
she
hasn
heard
Ykka
she
doesn
answer
for
long
moment
There
look
her
face
that
you
starting
not
like
You
can
say
you
really
know
her
any
more
now
than
you
did
when
you
were
grit
but
you
know
that
she
isn
the
grim
sort
That
she
grim
now
the
tightened
muscle
along
her
jawline
making
stand
out
more
than
you
know
she
likes
very
bad

She
something
She
says
Ykka

But
only
moved

She
rubs
her

Ykka
shakes
her
head
and
rises
cWell
least
you
haven
destroyed
the
rusting
comm
already
Tell
what
you
figured
out
then
Tonkee
turns
eye
her
warily
cThose
panels
along
the
wall
activate
and
regulate
the
water
pumps
and
air
circulation
systems
and
cooling
processes
But
you
knew
that
already
cYes
Since
not
dead
Ykka
dusts
off
her
hands
from
where
she
touched
the
floor
sidling
toward
Tonkee
way
that
somehow
simultaneously
thoughtful
and
subtly
menacing
She
not

most
Sanzed

good

shorter
than
Hjarka
Her
dangerousness
not
obvious
with
others
but
you
sense
the
slow
readying
her
orogeny
now
She
was
fully
prepared
smash
ice
her
way
into
this
place
The
Strongbacks
shift
and
edge

closer
too
reinforcing
her
unspoken
threat
cWhat
want

she
continues
cis
how
you

cWe
figured
out
those

and

Touch
one

and
gets
cooler
touch
another
and
the
communal
pool
water
gets
hotter
But
nothing
changed
the
past
week
Tonkee
sighs
little
learned
how
decipher
some
the
symbols
over
the
years
Spend
enough
time
these
kinds
ruins
and
you
see
the
same
things
repeated
over
and
over
Ykka
considers
this
then
nods
toward
the

around
the

Tonkee
walks
over

points

its
top

corner
nothing
intuitive:
something
green
and

like
but
squiggly
sort
pointed
downward

there
were

about

Ykka
lifts
her
chin
little
just
enough
that
you
know
Tonkee
has
guessed
right
cSo
this

from

The
others

this
cNo
never
seen

glances
you
once
and
away

than

about

were
made

comes
back
the
plinth
and
waves
the
warning
This
time
she
points
symbol
within
the
glowing
red
text:
solid
black
circle
surrounded
white
octagon
You
don
know
how
you
missed
before
stands
out
from
the
red
saw
that
mark
the
Fulcrum
painted
onto
some
the
light
panels
You
were
too
busy
staring
into
the
pit
don
think
you
saw
But
been
maybe
half
dozen
obelisk
builder
sites
since
and
that
mark
always
near
something
dangerous
She
watching
you
intently
find
dead
people
near
sometimes
Inadvertently
you
think
Guardian
Timay
Not
found
dead
but
dead
nevertheless
and
you
almost
joined
her
that
day
Then
you
remember
moment
the
room
without
doors
near
the
edge
the
yawning
pit
You
remember
small
needlelike
protrusions
from
the
walls
the
pit
exactly
like
these
bits

murmur

was

called

across

looks
sharply
you

Hjarka
annoyed

there
staring
the

cNo
this

Tonkee
glares
Hjarka
down

cIt

cWhat
asks
Ykka

are
you
talking
about
cTheir
enemy
Tonkee
leans
against
the
edge
the
plinth
carefully
you
note
but
emphatically
cThey
were
war
don
you
understand
Toward
the
end
just
before
their
civilization
vanished
into
the
dust
All
their
ruins
anything
that
left
from
that
time
are
defensive
survival
oriented
Like
the
comms
today
except
they
had
lot
more
than
stone
walls
help
protect
them
Things
like
giant
rusting
underground
geodes
They
hid
those
places
and
studied
their
enemy
and
maybe
built
weapons

She
pivots
and

the

flickers
just
she
does

say
automatically
Everyone
turns

But

You
don
know
how
say
without
telling
the
whole

story
and
you
reluctant
that
You
not
sure
why
Maybe
for
the
same
reason
that
Antimony
said
when
Alabaster
started

you:

cHow

when
went
into

You
snap
this
sharply
that
your
voice
echoes
the
room
and
startles
you
into
realizing
how
angry
you
are
One
the
Strongbacks
inhales
and
something
her
gaze
shifts
and
all
once
you
are
reminded
the
Strongbacks
Tirimo
who
looked
you
the
same
way
when
Rask
asked
them
let
you
through
the
gate
Even
Ykka
watching
you
way
that
wordlessly
says
You
scaring
the
locals
calm
the
rust
down
you
take
deep
breath
and
fall
silent
(It
only
later
that
you
will
recall
the
word
you
said
during
this
conversation
Burndown
You
will
wonder
why
you
said
what
means
and
you
will
have
answer
Tonkee
lets
out
deep
breath
carefully
and
this
seems
speak
for
the
room
cIt
possible
made
some
wrong
assumptions
she
says
Ykka
rubs
hand
over
her
hair
makes
her
head
look
incongruously
small
for
moment
until
floofs
back
cAll
right
already

before
Probably
several
times

asked

here
and

uneasily

nearly
shouting

looks

Ykka
steps
her
getting
right
her

and

goes
silent

rather
understand
nothing
about
this
place
Ykka
says
brutally
quiet
and
cold
now
cthan

Can
you
say
the
same
Tonkee
stares
back
her
trembling
visibly
and
saying
nothing
But
the
answer
obvious
isn
Tonkee
like
Hjarka
Both
were
raised
Leadership
raised
put
the
needs
others
first
and
both
chose
more
selfish
path
not
even
question
Which
why
later
retrospect
you
really
aren
surprised
what
happens
next
Tonkee
turns
and
lunges
and
the
red
warning
flashes
and
then
one
the
iron
bits
her
fist
She
already
turning
away
the
time
you
register
her
grab
Bolting
for
the
stair
door
Hjarka
gasps
Ykka
just
standing
there
little
startled
and
mostly
resigned
the
two
Strongbacks
stare
confusion
and
then
belatedly
start
after
Tonkee
But
then
instant
later
Tonkee
gasps
and
stumbles
halt
One
the
Strongbacks
grabs
her
arm
but
drops
immediately
when
Tonkee
yells
You
moving
before
you
think
Tonkee
yours
somehow
like
Hoa
like
Lerna
like
Alabaster
the
absence
your
children
you
trying
adopt
everybody
who
touches
you
emotionally
for
even
instant
You
don
even
like
Tonkee
Still
your
belly
clenches
when
you
grab
her
wrist
and
see
that
blood
streaks
her
hand
cWhat
the
Tonkee
looks
you:
quick
animal
panic
Then
she
jerks
and
cries
out
again
and
you
almost
let
this
time
because
something
moves
under
your
thumb
cThe
rust
Ykka
blurts
Hjarka
hand
claps
over
Tonkee
arm
too
helping
because
Tonkee
strong
her
panic
You
master
your
inexplicable
violent
revulsion
enough
instead
move
your
thumb
and
hold
Tonkee
wrist
that
you
can
get
good
look
Yes
There
something
moving
just
under
her
skin
jumps
and
jitters
but
moves
inexorably
upward
following
the
path

vein
there
just
large
enough
the

fragment

and

like

puts
the

your

fumbling
and

feels
like

but
you
keep
your
gaze
that

Where

going
You
too
quietly
horrified
speculate
But
before
you
can
put

place

the
moving
thing
loose
vanishes
Tonkee
screams
again
her
voice
breaking
and
horrible
gone
into
the
meat
her
You
slash
once
opening
deep
cut
just
above
the
elbow
which
should
ahead
the
thing
Tonkee
groans
cDeeper
can
feel
Deeper
and
you
hit

but
you
set
your
teeth
and
cut
deeper
There
blood
everywhere
Ignoring
Tonkee
pants
and
hisses
you
try
probe
for
the
thing
even
though
privately
you
terrified
you
find
and
into
your
flesh
next
cArterial
Tonkee
pants
She
shaking
keening
through
her
teeth
between
every
word
cLike

highroad
sessa
Fuck
She
claps
the
lower
half
her
bicep
farther
her
arm
than
you
expected
Moving
faster
now
that
reached
the
larger
arteries
Sessa
You
stare
Tonkee
for
moment
chilled
the
realization
that
she
was
trying
say
sessapinae
Ykka
reaches
over
you
and
wraps
hand
around
Tonkee
arm
just
below
the
deltoid
squeezing
tight
She
looks
you
but
you
know
there
only
one
thing
left
You
not
going
able
manage
with
the
tiny
knife
but
there
are
other
weapons
cHold
her
arm
out
Without
waiting
see
whether
Ykka
and
Hjarka
comply
you
grip
Tonkee
shoulder
Alabaster
trick
that
you
thinking
tiny
fine
spun
localized
torus
like
the
ones
used
kill
the
boilbugs
This
time
you
use
burrow
through
Tonkee
arm
and
freeze
the
little
iron
shard
Hopefully
But
you
extend
your
awareness
and
shut
your
eyes
concentrate
something
shifts
You
deep
the
heat
her
seeking
the
metallic
lattice
the
iron
shard
and
trying
sess
the
difference
between
its
structure
and
that
the
iron
her
blood
and
then
yes
The
silver
glimmer
magic
there
You
weren
expecting
that
here
amid
the
gelid
bobble
her
cells
Tonkee
isn
turning
into
stone
like
Alabaster
and
you
never
sessed
magic
any
other
living
creature
Yet
here
here
Tonkee
there
something
that
gleams
steadily
silverish
and
threadlike
coming
through
her
feet
from
where
doesn
matter
and
ending
the
iron
shard
wonder
the
thing
can
move
quickly
fueled
something
else
Using
this
power
source
stretches
forth
tendrils
its
own
link
into
Tonkee
flesh
and
drag
itself
along
This
why
hurts
her
because
every
cell
touches
shivers
burned
and
then
dies
The
tendrils
get
longer
with
every
contact
too
the
fucking
thing
growing
its
way
through
her
feeding
her
some
imperceptible
way
lead
tendril
feels
its
way
along
orienting
always
toward
Tonkee
sessapinae
and
you
know
instinctively
that
letting
get
there
will
Bad
You
try
grabbing
onto
the
root
thread
thinking
maybe
stall
starve
strength
but
there
hate
and
all
what
have
there
anger
and
hello
little
enemy
cHey
Hjarka
voice
your
ear
shout
cWake
the
fuck
You
jerk
out
the
fog
you
weren
aware
drifting
into
Okay
You
stay
away
from
the
root
tendril
lest
you
get
another
taste
whatever
driving
the
thing
That
instant
contact
was
worth
though
because
now
you
know
what
You
visualize
scissors
with
edges
infinite
fineness
and
blades
glimmering
silver
Cut
the
lead
Cut
the
tendrils
they
may
grow
again
Cut
the
contamination
before
can
set
hooks
any
deeper
her
You
thinking
Tonkee
you
this
Wanting
save
her
life
But
Tonkee
not
Tonkee
you
right
now
she
collection
particles
and
substances
You
make
the
cut
This
isn
your
fault
know
you
won
ever
believe
but
isn
And
when
you
manage
relax
your
sessapinae
and
adjust
your
perception
back
the
macro
scale
and
you
find
yourself
covered
absolutely
covered
blood
you
surprised
You
don
quite
understand
why
Tonkee
the
floor
gasping
her
body
surrounded
spreading
pool
Hjarka
shouts
one
the
Strongbacks
hand
her
his
belt
now
now
You
feel
the
jerk
the
iron
shard
nearby
and
twitch
alarm
because
you
know
now
what
those
things
are
trying
and
that
they
are
evil
But
when
you
turn
look
the
iron
shard
you
confused
because
all
you
see
smooth
bronze
skin
streaked
with
blood
and
scrap
familiar
cloth
Then
there
sort
twitchy
movement
weight
making
itself
known
your
hand
and
And
Well
You
holding
Tonkee
severed
arm
You
drop
Fling
more
like
violent
your
shock
bounces
just
beyond
Ykka
and
the
two
Strongbacks
who
are
clustering
around
Tonkee
and
doing
something
maybe
trying
save
her
life
you
can
even
wrap
your
head
around
that
because
now
you
see
that
the
cut
end
Tonkee
arm
perfect
slightly
slanted
cross
section
still
bleeding
and
twitching
because
you
just
cut
off
but
wait
that
not
the
only
reason
From
small
hole
near
the
bone
you
see
something
wriggle
forth
The
hole
the
cross
section
artery
The
something
the

which
drops
the
smooth
green
floor
and
then
lies
amid
the
splattered
blood
nothing
more
than
harmless
bit
metal
