pull
you
aside
Figuratively
speaking
cThe
one
you
call
Gray
Man
doesn
want
prevent
the
opening
the
Gate

lied
You
wary

troubles
you
can
see
you
want
trust
even
your
very
eyes
remind
you
how
deceived
you
But
you
sigh
and
say
cYeah
thought
there
might
more
cHe
kill
you
because
you
can
manipulated
say
ignoring
the
irony
cBecause
you
open
the
Gate
you
would
restore
the
Moon
and
end
the
Seasons
What
really
wants
someone
who
will
open
the
Gate
for
his
purposes
You
understand
the
players
now
not
the
totality
the
game
You
frown
cSo
which
purpose
would
that
Transformation
Status
quo
don
know
Does
matter

not
You
rub

Alabaster
There
not
much
left
him
anymore
Since
gave
his
legs
spends
his
days
drugged
stupor
tucked
against
Antimony
like
pup
nursing
its
mother
Sometimes
you
don
ask
for
lessons
when
you
come
see
him
That
waste
because
you
pretty
sure
the
only
reason
forced
himself
keep
living
that
can
pass
the
art
global
destruction
you
caught
you
few
times:
You
woken
curled
next
his
nest
find
him
gazing
down
you
doesn
chide
you
for
Probably
doesn
have
the
strength
chide
You
grateful
awake
now
you
settle
beside
him
though
doesn
move
much
Antimony
has
moved
fully
into
the
nest
with
him
these
days
and
you
rarely
see
her
any
pose
other
than
cliving
chair
for
him
kneeling
legs
spread
her
hands
braced
her
thighs
Alabaster
rests
against
her
front
which
only
possible
now
because
perversely
the
few
burns
his
back
healed
even
his
legs
rotted
Fortunately
she
has
breasts
make
the
position
less
comfortable
and
apparently
her
simulated
clothing
isn
sharp
rough
Alabaster
eyes
shift
follow
you
sit
like
stone
eater
You
hate
that
this
comparison
occurs
you
cIt
happening
again
you
say
You
don
bother
explain
the
cit
always
knows
cHow
did
you
Meov
You
tried
How
Because
you
can
find
yourself
anymore
bother
fighting
for
this
place
building
life
here
All
your
instincts
say
grab
your
runny
sack
grab
your
people
and
run
before
Castrima
turns
against
you
That
probable
death
sentence
the
Season
having
well
and
truly
set
topside
but
staying
seems
more
certain
draws
deep
slow
breath
you
know

answer
just
takes
him
while
muster
the
words
cDidn

For
while
You
shake
your
head
course
knew
you
were
pregnant
before
you
did
That
all
irrelevant
now
cYou
fought

takes
effort
emphasize
the
last
word
but

For
you
and
Corundum
and
Innon

but
fought
for
Meov
too
cThey
would

day
You

Corundum
proved

powerful

off
the
Guardians
only
have
leave

and

elsewhere

inevitable

affirmative
sound
cThen
why

cThere

You
shake
your
head
The
words
are
impossible
believe
that
they
sound
like
gibberish
But
adds
cAny
chance
was
worth
trying
does
not

for
you

you

sessable
beneath

surface
your
family
could
have
normal
life

Normal

Normal

You
stare
him
impulse
you
lift
your
hand
his
face
drawing
fingers
over
his
scarred
lips
watches
you
this
and
offers
you
that
little
quarter
smile
which
all
can
muster

Ykka

the
next

twenty
four
hours
after
Rennanis
coffer
Castrima
needs
deliver
some
kind
response
but
she
doesn
think
should
only
her
informal
council
You
can
see
what

the
vote
will
make

Cutter
says

Not
all
them
have
the
skill
throw
torus
control
themselves
well
except
for
you
and
Alabaster
they

But
Cutter
will
make
sure

can

who

His

impassive
adds
cAnd
who
watch

Which
means

The
revulsion
that
shivers
through
you

You
never

you
don

Ykka
protests
and
then
head
her

(This
will
have
the
added
purpose
making
hard
for
Cutter
find
you
She
still
asleep
from
the
sound
her
breathing
through
the
bedroom
curtain
Her
divans
are
pretty
comfortable
especially
compared
sleeping
rough
when
you
were
the
road
You
use
your
runny
sack
for
pillow
and
curl
trying
forget
the
world
for
while
And
then
you
wake
when
Ykka
curses
and
stumbles
past
you
full
speed
half
ripping
down
one
the
apartment
curtains
her
haste
You
struggle
awake
and
sit
cWhat
But
then
you
too
hear
the
rising
shouts
outside
Angry
shouts
crowd
gathering
begun
You
get
and
follow
and
not
afterthought
that
you
grab
the
packs
The
knot
people
gathered
the
ground
level
near
the
communal
baths
Ykka
scrambles
that
level
ways
you
will
not
sliding
down
metal
ladders
hopping
over
the
railing
one
platform
swing
down
the
one
she
knows
below
running
across
bridges
that
sway
alarmingly
beneath
her
feet
You
down

sensible
non
suicidal
way
the
time
you

trying
get
everyone
shut
and

and

clad

for

Now

And
five
feet
away
the
iced
corpse
man
sits
the

frozen
mid
scrabble
backward

abject
terror
permanently
his
face
You
don
recognize
him
That
doesn

What
matters
that
rogga
has
killed
still
This
match
thrown
right
into
the
middle
comm
that
dried
out
oil
soaked
kindling
how
this
happened
Ykka
shouting
you
reach
the
knot
people
You
can
barely
see
her
there
are
nearly
fifty
people
here
already
You
could
push
the
front
but
you
decide
hang
back
instead
Now
not
the
time
call
attention
yourself
You
look
around
and
see
Lerna
also
lurking
the
rear
the
crowd
His
eyes
are
wide
and
his
jaw
tight
looks
back
you
There
also
burning
Earth
cluster
three
rogga
kids
here
One
them
Penty
who
you
know
the
ringleader
some
the
braver
stupider
rogga
children
She
standing
tiptoe
craning
her
neck
for
better
look
When
she
tries
push
forward
through
the
crowd
you
catch
her
eye
and
give
her
Mother
Look
She
flinches
and
subsides
once
cWho
the
rust
cares
how
happened
That
Sekkim
one
the
Innovators
You
only
know
him
because
Tonkee
constantly
complains
that
too
stupid
rightly
part
the
caste
and
should
instead
dumped
into
something
nonessential
like
Leadership
cThis
why
Someone
else
shouts
him
down
Fucking
rogga
Someone
else
shouts
her
down
cFucking
listen
Ykka
cWho
the
rust
cares
about
another
rogga
monster
cRusty
son
cannibal
will
beat
you
bloody
you
Someone
shoves
someone
else
There
are
shoves
back
more
curses
vows
murder
catastrophe
Then
man
rushes
forward
from
the
crowd
crouching
beside
the
iced
corpse
and
trying
his
best
fling
his
arms
around
The
resemblance
between
him
and
the
body
obvious
even
through
the
ice:
brothers
perhaps
His
wail
anguish
causes
sudden
flustered
silence
ripple
across
the
crowd
They
shuffle
uneasily
his
wail
subsides
into
deep
soul
tearing
sobs
Ykka
takes
deep
breath
and
steps
forward
using
the
opportunity
that
grief
has
provided
Cutter
she
says
tightly
cWhat
did
say
What
did
rusting
say
cHe
attacked
Cutter
says
There
not
scratch
him
cBullshit
Ykka
says
Several
people
the
crowd
echo
her
but
she
glares
them
down
until
they
subside
She
looks
the
dead
man
her
jaw
tight
cBetine
wouldn
have
done
that
couldn
even
kill
chicken
that
time
was
his
turn
look
after
the
flock
Cutter
glares
cAll
know
wanted
take
bath
sat
down
wash
and
moved
away
from
figured
fine
that
how
going
and
didn
care
Then
went
past
him
get
into
the
pool
and
hit
Hard
the
back
the
neck
There
low
angry
murmur
this
but
also
troubled
shuffle
The
back
the
neck
rumored
the
best
place
strike
rogga
not
true
Only
works
you
hit
hard
enough
for
concussion
cracked
skull
and
then
that
what
takes
them
down
not
any
sort
damage
the
sessapinae
still
popular
myth
And
true
might
reason
enough
for
Cutter
fight
back
Rust

This
growled
the
man
who
holds
Betine
faintly
hissing

cBets

Ykka
nods
going
over
touch

The
crowd
shuffles
again

with
With

moment

her
jaw
flexes
once
twice
She
looks
around

Several
people

woman
She
swallows
looking

her
upper

just
wanted

closer

what

somebody
looks

that
Ykka
cuts
him
off
with

Cutter
but
shut
What
else
she
asks
the
woman
cThat
was
looked
away
and
then
when
looked
back
there
was
that
swirl
Wind
and
ice
She
grimaces
her
jaw
tightening
cYou

Ykka
glares
back
her
but
then
flinches
there
are
more
shouts
this
time
agreement
with
the
woman
Someone
tries
shove
through
the
crowd
get
Cutter
someone
else
holds
the
attacker
back
but
near
thing
You
see
the
realization
come
over
Ykka
that
she
losing
them
She
not
going
make
her
people
see
They
working
themselves
into
mob
and
there
nothing
she
can
stop
them
Well
You
wrong
about
that
There
one
thing
she
can
She
does
turning
and
laying
hand
Cutter
chest
and
sending
something
through
him
You
not
actively
sessing
the
moment
you
only
get
the
backwash
and
what
like
the
way
Alabaster
once
slammed
hot
spot
into
submission
years
ago
and
fifth
continent
away
Just
smaller
like
what
that
Guardian
did
Innon
except
localized
and
not
overtly
horrific
And
you
didn
realize
roggas
could
anything
like
Whatever
Cutter
doesn
even
have
chance
gasp
His
eyes
fly
wide
staggers
back
step
Then
falls
down
with
look
shock
his
face
match
that
Betine
fear
Everyone
silent
Yours
not
the
only
mouth
that
hangs
open
Ykka
catches
her
breath
Whatever
she
did
took
lot
out
her
you
see
her
sway
little
then
get
hold
herself
cThat
enough
she
says
turning
look
everyone
the
crowd
cMore
than
enough
Justice

Now
all

You

that
what
you
doing
Ykka
sitting
divan
with
her
arms
wrapped
around
her
knees
and
her
head
propped
against
the
wall
gaze
weary
and
empty
thought
When
you
hear
shouts
again
you
close
your
eyes
and
think
about
ignoring
them
the
high
pitched
screams
children
that
drag
you
out
this
complete
failure
empathy
The
others
get
and
you
too
and
all
you
out
onto
the
balcony
People
are
running
toward
one
the
wide
platforms
that
surround
crystal
shaft
too
small
hold
any
apartments
You
and
the
others
head
that
way
too
The
comm
uses
such
platforms
for
storage
this
one
stacked
with
barrels
and
crates
and
clay
jars
One
the
clay
jars
rolling
around
but
looks
intact
you
see
this
you
and
the
others
reach
the
platform
Which
does
not
all
explain
what
else
you
seeing
the
rogga
kids
again
Penty
gang
Two
them
are
doing
all
the
screaming
tugging
and
hitting
woman
who
has
pinned
Penty
down
and
shouting
her
gripping
her
throat
Another
woman
stands
yelling
the
kids
too
but
one
paying
any
attention
her
Her
slurred
voice
just
the
goad
You
know
the
woman
that
got
Penty
down
sort
She
maybe
ten
years
younger
than
you
with
heavier
build
and
longer
hair:
Waineen
one
the
Resistants
She
been
nice
enough
when
you
done
shifts
the
fungus
flats
latrines
but
you
heard
the
others
gossip
behind
her
back
Waineen
makes
the
mellows
that
Lerna
periodically
smokes
and
the
moonshine
that
few
people
the
comm
drink
Sometime
back
before
the
Season
she
had
quite
lucrative
sideline
helping
the
native
Castrimans
perk
their
lives
tedious
mining
and
trading
and
she
stored
the
product
down
Castrima
under
keep
the
quartent
tax
inspectors
from
ever
finding
Convenient
now
that
the
world
has
ended
But
she
her
own
biggest
customer
and
not
unusual
find
her
stumbling
about
the
comm
red
faced
and
too
loud
emitting
more
fumes
than
fresh
blow
Waineen
not
usually
mean
drunk
and
she
shares
freely
and
she
never
misses
shift
which
why
nobody
really
cares
what
she
does
with
her
stuff
Everybody
handles
the
Season
their
own
way
Still
something
set
her
off
now
Penty
aggravating
Hjarka
and
some
the
other
Castrimans
are
striding
forward
pull
the
woman
off
the
girl
and
you
telling
yourself
good
thing
Penty
has
enough
self
control
not
ice
the
whole
damned
platform
when
the
woman
lifts
arm
and
makes
fist
fist
that
you
seen
the
imprint
Jija

with
four
parallel
marks
Uche
belly
and
face

that
that
that
You
the
topaz
and
between
the
woman
cells
almost
the
same
instant
There
thought
this
Your
mind
falls
dives
into
the
upward
wash
yellow
light
belongs
there
Your
sessapinae
flex
around
the
silver
threads
and
you
draw
them
together
you
are
part
both
obelisk
and
woman
and
you
will
not
let
this
happen
not
again
not
again
you
could
not
stop
Jija
but
cNot
one
more
child
you
whisper
and
your
companions
all
look
you
surprise
and
confusion
Then
they
stop
looking
you
because
the
woman
who
was
egging
the
fight
suddenly
screaming
and
the
kids
are
screaming
louder
Even
Penty
screaming
now
because
the
woman
top
her
has
turned
glittering
multicolored
stone
cNot
one
more
child
You
can
sess
the
ones
nearest
you
the
other
council
members
the
screaming
drunk
Penty
and
her
girls
Hjarka
and
the
rest
all
them
Everyone
Castrima
They
trod
upon
the
filaments
your
nerves
tapping
and
jittering
and
they
are
Jija
You
focus
the
drunk
woman
and
almost
instinctual
the
urge
begin
squeezing
the
movement
and
life
out
her
and
replacing
that
with
whatever
the
product
magical
reactions
really
this
stuff
that
looks
like
stone
This
stuff
that
killing
Alabaster
the
father
your
other
dead
child
NOT
ONE
MORE
RUSTING
CHILD
For
how
many
centuries
has
the
world
killed
rogga
children
that
everyone
else
children
can
sleep
easy
Everyone
Jija
the
whole
damned
world
Schaffa
Castrima
Tirimo
the
Fulcrum
NOT
ONE
MORE
and
you
turn
with
the
obelisk
torrenting
its
power
through
you
begin
killing
everyone
within
and
beyond
your
sight
Something
jars
your
connection
the
obelisk
Suddenly
you
have
fight
for
power
that
readily
gave
you
before
You
bare
your
teeth
without
thinking
growl
without
hearing
yourself
clench
your
fists
and
shout
your
mind
WON
LET
HIM
AGAIN
and
you
are
seeing
Schaffa
thinking
Jija
But
you
are
sessing
Alabaster
Feeling
him
blazing
white
tendrils
that
lash
your
obelisk
link
That
Alabaster
strength
contending
against
yours
and
not
winning
does
not
shut
you
down
the
way
you
know
can
the
way
you
thought
could
weaker
You
just
lot
stronger
than
you
used
And
suddenly
the
import
this
slaps
through
the
fugue
memory
and
horror
that
you
trapped
bringing
you
back
cold
shocking
reality
You
killed
woman
with
magic
You
about
wipe
out
Castrima
with
magic
You
fighting
Alabaster
with
magic
and
Alabaster
cannot
bear
more
magic
cOh
uncaring
Earth
you
whisper
You
stop
fighting
once
Alabaster
dismantles
your
connection
the
obelisk
still
got
more
precise
touch
than
you
But
you
feel
his
weakness
when
does
His
fading
strength
You
not
even
aware
running
first
barely
qualifies
running
because
the
contest
magic
and
the
abrupt
disconnection
from
the
obelisk
have
left
you
disoriented
and
weak
that
you
lurch
from
railing
rope
drunk
yourself
Someone
shouting
your
ear
hand
grabs
your
upper
arm
and
you
shake
off
snarling
Somehow
you
make
the
ground
floor
without
falling
your
death
Faces
blur
past
you
irrelevant
You
can
see
because
you
sobbing
aloud
babbling
You
know
what
you
done
even
you
deny
with
your
words
and
body
and

Then
you

agrees
cNo

She
sits

with
the
stone
lump

was
Alabaster
resting
against

did
Her

are

cYou

says

You
try

try

her
but
the
fury
dissolves
into
shame
And
anyway
you
only
get
far
that
damned
obelisk
longknife
Alabaster
The
spinel
kicks
back
your
flailing
grab
for
almost
once
spitting
your
face
You
are
worthy
contempt
aren
you
The
stone
eaters
the
humans
the
orogenes
even
the
flaking
obelisks
all
know
You
are
nothing
you
are
death
And
you
killed

another

you
loved
you
sit
there

bereft
rejected

There

now
Her

imposing
straight

and
implacable
She
looks
down

remains
From

through

and
the
way

With
