JOURNEY
SOUTH
FOR
small
caps
ASSUN
and
her
father
long
and
fraught
They
make
most
the
journey
with
the
horse
cart
which
means
that
they
travel
faster
than
Essun
who
foot
and
behind
them
increasing
degree
Jija
offers
rides
exchange
for
food
supplies
this
helps
them
move
faster
still
because
they
don
need
stop
and
trade
often
Because
this
pace
they
stay
ahead
the
worst
the
changing
climate
the
ashfall
the
carnivorous
kirkhusa
and
the
boilbugs
and
all
the
worse
things
brewing
the
lands
behind
them
They
going
quickly
when
they
pass
through
Castrima
over
that
Nassun
barely
feels
Ykka
summons
and
when
she
does
her
dreams
drawing
her
down
and
down
into
the
warm
earth
amid
white
crystalline
light
But
she
dreams
this
ten
miles
past
Castrima
since
Jija
thought
they
could
little
farther
that
day
before
camping
and
thus
they
not
fall
prey
the
honeypot
invitingly
whole
empty
buildings
When
they
have
stop
comms
some
are
only
lockdown
and
haven
yet
declared
Seasonal
Law
Hoping
the
worst
won
come
far
south
probably
rare
for
Seasons
affect
the
whole
continent
once
Nassun
never
speaks
what
she
strangers
but
she
could
she
would
tell
them
that
there
nowhere
hide
from
this
Season
Some
parts
the
Stillness
will
suffer
the
full
effects
later
than
others
but
eventually
will
bad
everywhere
Some
the
comms
they
stop
invite
them
stay
Jija
older
but
still
hale
and
strong
and
his
knapping
skills
and
Resistant
use
caste
make
him
valuable
Nassun
young
enough
trained
nearly
any
needed
skill
and
she
visibly
healthy
and
tall
for
her
age
already
showing
signs
growing
into
her
mother
strong
Midlatter
frame
There
are
few
places
they
stop
strong
comms
with
deep
stores
and
friendly
people
where
she
wishes
they
could
stay
Jija
always
refuses
though
got
some
destination
mind
few
the
comms
they
pass
try
kill
them
There
logic
this
since
one
man
and
little
girl
cannot
possibly
have
enough
valuables
between
them
worth
murdering
but
there
isn
much
logic
Season
They
run
from
some
Jija
takes
longknife
man
head
get
them
out
comm
that
has
let
them
through
the
gates
and
then
tried
close
them
They
lose
the
horses
and
the
cart
which
probably
what
the
comm
wanted
but
Jija
and
Nassun
escape
which
what
matters
most
foot
from
there
and
slower
but
they
are
alive
another
comm
whose
people
don
even
bother
warn
them
before
aiming
crossbows
Nassun
who
saves
them
She
does
this
wrapping
her
arms
around
her
father
and
setting
her
teeth
the
earth
and
dragging
every
iota
life
and
heat
and
movement
out
the
whole
comm
until
gleaming
frosted
confection
ice
slivered
slate
walls
and
still
solid
bodies
(She
will
never
this
again
The
way
Jija
looks
her
afterward
They
stay
the
dead
comm
for
few
days
resting
empty
houses
and
replenishing
their
supplies
one
bothers
this
comm
while
they
are
there
because
Nassun
keeps
the
walls
iced
clear
danger
here
warn
off
They
cannot
stay
long
course
Eventually
the
other
comms
the
area
will
band
together
and
come
kill
the
rogga
whom
they
will
assume
threatens
them
all
few
days
warm
water
and
fresh
food
Jija
cooks
one
the
comm
frozen
chickens
for
real
treat
and
they
move
Before
the
bodies
thaw
and
start
stinking
see
And
goes:
Bandits
and
scammers
and
near
fatal
gas
waft
and
tree
that
fires
wooden
spikes
when
warm
bodies
are
proximity
they
survive
all
Nassun
has
growth
spurt
even
though
she
always
hungry
and
rarely
full
the
time
they
finally
approach
the
place
that
Jija
has
heard
about
she
three
inches
taller
and
year
has
passed
They
are
out
the
Somidlats
last
edging
into
the
Antarctics
Nassun
has
begun
suspect
that
Jija
means
take
her
all
the
way
Nife
one
the
few
cities
the
Antarctic
region
near
which
satellite
Fulcrum
said
located
But
turns
them
off
the
Pellestane
Nife
Imperial
Road
and
they
begin
going
eastward
stopping
periodically
that
Jija
can
consult
with
people
along
the
way
and
see
going
the
right
direction
after
one
these
conversations
conducted
always
whispers
and
always
after
Jija
thinks
Nassun
has
gone
sleep
and
only
with
people
whom
Jija
considers
level
headed
after
few
hours
chitchat
and
shared
food
that
Nassun
finally
learns
where
they
are
going
Tell
she
hears
Jija
whisper
woman
who
was
out
scouting
for
local
comm
after
they
have
shared
evening
meal
meat
she
caught
around
fire
Jija
built
have
you
ever
heard
the
Moon
The
question
holds
meaning
for
Nassun
neither
does
the
word
the
end
But
the
woman
inhales
She
directs
Jija
shift
over
the
southeast
running
regional
road
instead
the
Imperial
Road
and
then
divert
due
south
the
turning
river
they
soon
reach
Thereafter
Nassun
pretends
asleep
because
she
can
feel
the
woman
narrow
eyed
gaze
her
Eventually
though
Jija
shyly
offers
help
warm
her
bedroll
Then
Nassun
has
listen
while
her
father
works
make
the
woman
moan
and
gasp
repayment
for
the
meat
and
make
her
forget
that
Nassun
there
the
morning
they
move
before
the
woman
wakes
that
she
will
not
follow
and
try
hurt
Nassun
Days
later
they
divert
the
river
heading
into
the
woods
along
tree
shadowed
path
that
barely
more
than
tamped
down
paler
ribbon
amid
the
forest
scrub
and
undergrowth
The
sky
has
not
been
completely
shadowed
for
long
this
part
the
world
most
the
trees
still
have
leaves
and
Nassun
can
even
hear
animals
leaping
about
and
darting
away
they
pass
Occasionally
birds
twitter
croon
There
are
other
people
this
path
though
obviously
some
have
passed
recently
the
path
would
even
more
overgrown
than
The
Antarctics
are
stark
sparsely
populated
part
the
world
she
remembers
reading
the
textbooks
another
life
Few
comms
fewer
Imperial
roads
winters
that
are
harsh
even
outside
Season
The
quartents
here
take
weeks
travel
across
Swaths
the
Antarctics
are
tundra
and
the
southernmost
tip
the
continent
said
become
solid
ice
which
extends
far
into
the
sea
She
read
that
the
night
sky
they
could
see
through
the
clouds
sometimes
filled
with
strange
dancing
colored
lights
this
part
the
Antarctics
though
the
air
almost
steamy
despite
the
light
chill
Beneath
their
feet
Nassun
can
sess
the
heavy
pent
churn
active
shield
volcano
actually
erupting
just
very
slowly
with
trickle
trickle
lava
flow
further
south
Here
and
there
the
topography
her
awareness
Nassun
can
detect
gas
vents
and
few
boils
that
have
come
the
surface
hot
springs
and
geysers
All
this
moisture
and
the
warm
ground
are
what
keep
the
trees
green
Then
the
trees
part
and
before
them
looms
something
that
Nassun
has
never
seen
before
rock
formation
she
thinks
but
one
that
seems
consist
dozens
long
columnar
ribbons
brown
gray
stone
that
ripple
upslope
gradually
slanting
high
enough
qualify
low
mountain
tall
hill
the
top
this
river
stone
she
can
see
bushy
green
tree
canopies
the
formation
plateaus
there
Atop
that
plateau
Nassun
can
glimpse
something
through
the
trees
which
might
rounded
rooftop
storecache
tower
settlement
some
kind
But
unless
they
climb
along
the
columnar
ribbons
which
looks
dangerous
she
not
sure
how
get
there
Except
except
scratch
her
awareness
rising
pressure
itching
into
certainty
Nassun
glances
her
father
who
staring
the
river
stone
too
the
months
since
Uche
death
she
has
come
understand
Jija
better
now
than
ever
before
her
life
because
her
life
depends
She
understands
that
fragile
despite
his
outward
strength
and
stolidity
The
cracks
him
are
new
but
dangerous
like
the
edges
tectonic
plates:
always
raw
never
stable
needing
only
the
merest
brush
unleash
aeons
worth
pent
energy
and
destroy
everything
nearby
But
earthquakes
are
easy
manage
you
know
how
Nassun
says
watching
him
carefully
cThis
was
made
orogenes
Daddy
She
has
guessed
that
will
tense
and
does
She
has
guessed
that
will
need
take
deep
breath
calm
himself
which
also
does
reacts
even
the
thought
orogenes
the
way
that
Mama
used
react
red
wine:
with
fast
breath
and
shaking
hands
and
sometimes
freezing
weak
knees
Daddy
could
never
even
bring
things
that
were
burgundy
colored
into
the
house
but
sometimes
would
forget
and
anyway
and
once
was
done
there
was
reasoning
with
Mama
Nothing
done
but
wait
for
her
shakes
and
rapid
breathing
and
hand
wringing
pass
(Hand
rubbing
Nassun
did
not
notice
the
distinction
but
Essun
was
rubbing
one
hand
The
old
ache
there
the
bones
Once
Jija
calm
enough
therefore
Nassun
adds
think
only
orogenes
can
get
that
slope
too
She
sure
this
fact
The
stone
columns
are
moving
imperceptibly
This
whole
region
volcano
exquisitely
slow
eruption
Here
pushes
steady
incremental
lava
flow
that
takes
years
cool
and
thus
separates
itself
into
these
long
hexagonal
shafts
the
stuff
contracts
would
easy
for
orogene
even
untrained
one
push
against
that
upwelling
pressure
taste
some
that
slow
cooling
heat
and
raise
another
column
Ride
reach
that
plateau
Many
the
stone
ribbons
before
them
are
paler
gray
fresher
sharper
Others
have
done
this
recently
Then
Daddy
surprises
her
nodding
jerkily
cThere
are
there
should
others
like
you
this
place
never
says
the
word
the
word
always

first
time

faster

her
that
way
often
does
when
struggling

that
she

daughter

his

for

The
way

should
smile
his
daughter
cThey
can
cure
you
Nassun
That
what
the
stories
say
Cure
her
what
she
almost
asks
Then
survival
instinct
kicks
and
she
bites
her
tongue
before
she
can
say
the
stupid
thing
There
only
one
disease
that
afflicts
her
his
eyes
only
one
poison
would
journey
halfway
across
the
world
have
drawn
out
his
little
girl

For
orogeny
She
hardly
knows
what
think
other
than
what
she
normal
that
even
possible
She
stunned
that
she
forgets
watch
her
father
for
moment
When
she
remembers
she
shivers
because
has
been
watching
her
nods
satisfaction
the
look
her
face
though
Her
surprise
what
wanted

that
maybe

would
have
reacted
poorly

she
asks
Curiosity

tolerate

know
But
heard
about
from
travelers
before
Just
there
only
one

only
one

seen
few
comms
that
protected
themselves
not
just
with
walls
but
seemingly
insurmountable
obstacles
and
camouflage
Doubtless
the
members
the
comm
know
some
secret
way
get
the
plateau
but
without
this
knowledge
Nassun
and
Jija
are
left
with
puzzle
solve
There
also
easy
way
past
the
rise
they
could
around
see
there
are
steps
the
other
side
but
that
might
take
days
Nassun
sits
down
log
nearby
after
checking
carefully
for
insects
other
creatures
that
might
have
turned
aggressive
since
the
start
the
Season
(Nassun
has
learned
treat
nature
and
her
father
with
the
same
wary
caution
She
watches
Jija
pace
back
and
forth
pausing
now
and
again
kick
one
the
ribbons
where
rises
sharply
from
the
ground
mutters
himself
need
time
admit
what
must
done
Finally
turns
her
cCan
you
She
stands
stumbles
back
startled
the
sudden
movement
then
stops
and
glowers
her
She
just
stands
there
letting
him
see
how
much
hurts
her
that
fears
her
muscle
flexes
his
jaw
some
his
anger
fades
into
chagrin
(Only
some
cWill
you
have
kill

She
can
understand
some
his
worry

She
points

the

hatred

flashes
her
But
pointless
hate
Father
Earth

the
Seasons
would
end
takes
deep
breath
and
opens
his
mouth
and
Nassun
expecting
him
say
all
right
that
she
already
beginning
form
the
smile
that
will
need
reassurance
Thus
they
are
both
caught
completely
off
guard
when
loud
clack
resounds
through
the
forest
around
them
setting
off
flock
birds
she
didn
know
was
there
Something
chuffs
into
the
ground
nearby
making
Nassun
blink
with
the
faint
reverberations
the
blow
through
the
local
strata
Something
small
but
striking
with
force
And
then
Jija
screams
Once
Nassun
froze
reaction
being
startled
Mama
training
Some
that
conditioning
has
slipped
over
the
past
year
and
although
she
grows
still
she
sinks
her
awareness
into
the
earth
nevertheless
just
few
feet
but
still
But
she
freezes
two
kinds
ways
she
sees
the
heavy
huge
barbed
metal
bolt
that
has
been
shot
through
her
father
calf
cDaddy
Jija
down
one
knee
clutching
his
leg
and
making
sound
through
his
teeth
that
less
than
scream
but
less
agonized
The
thing
huge:
several
feet
long
two
inches
circumference
She
can
see
the
way
has
pushed
aside
his
flesh
its
terrible
path
The
tip
buried
the
ground
the
other
side
his
calf
effectively
pinning
him
place
harpoon
not
crossbow
bolt
even
has
thin
chain
attached
the
blunt
end
chain
Nassun
whirls
following
Someone
holding
There
are
feet
pounding
the
strata
nearby
crunching
leaves
they
move
Darting
shadows
flicker
past
tree
trunks
and
vanish
she
hears
call
some
Arctic
language
she
heard
before
but
does
not
know
Bandits
Coming
She
looks
Daddy
again
who
trying
take
deep
breaths
His
face
pale
There
much
blood
But
looks
her
with
his
eyes
wide
and
white
with
pain
and
suddenly
she
remembers
the
comm
where
the
people
attacked
them
the
comm
she
iced
and
the
way
looked
her
afterward
Bandits
Kill
them
She
knows
she
must
she
does
not
they
will
kill
her
But
her
father
wants
little
girl
not
animal
She
stares
and
stares
and
breathes
hard
and
cannot
stop
staring
cannot
think
cannot
act
can
nothing
but
stand
there
and
shake
and
hyperventilate
torn
between
survival
and
daughterhood
Then
someone
leaps
down
the
lava
flow
ridge
bouncing
from
one
ribbon
rock
the
other
with
speed
and
agility
that
Nassun
stares
one
can
that
But
the
man
lands
crouch
amid
the
gravelly
soil
the
foot
the
ridges
with
heavy
ominous
thud
solidly
built
She
can
tell
big
even
though
stays
low
half
rises
his
gaze
fixed
something
the
trees
beyond
Nassun
and
draws
long
wicked
glassknife
(And
yet
somehow
the
weight
his
landing
the
ground
does
not
reverberate
her
senses
What
does
that
mean
And
there
She
shakes
her
head
thinking
maybe
insect
but
the
odd
buzzing
sensation
and
not
sound
Then
the
man
off
running
straight
into
the
brush
his
feet
pushing
against
the
ground
with
such
force
that
clods
dirt
kick
his
wake
Nassun
mouth
falls
open
she
turns
follow
him
losing
track
amid
the
green
but
there
are
shouts
that
language
again
and
then
the
direction
that
she
saw
the
man
run
soft
guttural
sound
like
someone
reacting
hard
blow
The
moving
people
amid
the
trees
stop
Nassun
sees
Arctic
woman
stand
frozen
the
clear
gap
between
tangle
vines
and
old
weathered
rock
The
woman
turns
inhaling
call
out
someone
else
and
near
blur
the
man
behind
her
punching
her
the
back
the
knife
And
then
gone
before
the
woman
falls
The
violence
and
speed
the
attack
are
stunning
Nassun
Jija
says
and
Nassun
jumps
again
She
actually
forgot
him
for
moment
She
goes
over
crouching
and
putting
her
foot
the
chain
prevent
anyone
from
using
hurt
him
further

She
tries
figure
out
how
the
chain
fastened
the
harpoon
The
weapon
shaft
smooth
she
can
get
the
chain
loose
cut
off
the
barbed
point
they
can
just
drag
Daddy
leg
off
free
him
But
what
then
such
terrible
wound
Will
bleed
death
She
doesn
know
what
Jija
hisses
she
jiggles
the
end
the
chain
experimentally
trying
see
she
can
twist
loose
don
think
the
bone
Jija
actually
sways
and
Nassun
thinks
the
white
his
lips
bad
sign
She
ignores
him
The
chain
welded
loop
the
end
the
shaft
She
fingers
and
thinks
hard
now
that
the
strange
man
appearance
has
broken
her
deadlock
(Her
hand
shaking
though
She
takes
deep
breath
trying
get
hold
her
own
fear
Somewhere
off
the
trees
there
gurgling
groan
and
scream
fury
She
knows
Jija
has
some
his
stoneknapping
tools
his
pack
but
the
harpoon
steel
Wait
metal
breaks
cold
enough
doesn
Could
she
maybe
with
high
narrow
torus
She
never
done
this
before
she
does
wrong
she
freeze
off
his
leg
Yet
somehow
instinctively
she
feels
certain
that
can
done
The
way
Mama
taught
her
think
about
orogeny
heat
and
movement
taken
and
heat
and
movement
pushed
out
has
never
really
felt
right
her
There
truth
works
she
knows
from
experience
But
something
about
off
Inelegant
She
has
often
thought
don
think
about
heat
without
ever
finishing
that
thought
productive
way
Mama
not
here
and
death
and
her
father
the
only
person
left
the
world
who
loves
her
even
though
his
love
comes
wrapped
pain
she
puts
hand
the
butt

the
harpoon
cDon

Daddy
cWh
what
Jija
shaking
but
also
weakening
rapidly
Good
Nassun
can
work
with
her
concentration
uninterrupted
She
puts
her
free
hand
his
leg
since
her
orogeny
has
always
flinched
away
from
freezing
her
even
back
when
she
couldn
fully
control
and
closes
her
eyes
There
something
underneath
the
heat
the
volcano
interspersed
amid
the
wavelets
motion
that
dance
through
the
earth
easy
manipulate
the
waves
and
heat
but
hard
even
perceive
this
other
thing
which
perhaps
why
Mama
taught
Nassun
look
for
waves
and
heat
instead
But
Nassun
can
grasp
the
other
thing
which
finer
and
more
delicate
and
also
more
precise
than
the
heat
and
waves
she
can
shape
into
kind
sharp
edge
and
file
down
infinite
fineness
and
slice
across
the
shaft
like
There
quick
high
pitched
hiss
the
air
between
her
and
Jija
stirs
Then
the
chain
tip
the
harpoon
shaft
drops
loose
the
shorn
faces
metal
glimmering
mirror
smooth
the
afternoon
light
Exhaling
relief
Nassun
opens
her
eyes
find
that
Jija
has
tensed
and
staring
beyond
her
with
expression
mingled
horror
and
belligerence
Startled
Nassun
whirls
see
the
knife
wielding
man
behind
her
His
hair
black
Arctic
limp
and
long
enough
fall
below
his
waist
very
tall
that
she
falls
onto
her
butt
turning
look
him
maybe
that
because
she
suddenly
exhausted
She
does
not
know
The
man
breathing
hard
and
his
clothing
homespun
cloth
and
pair
surprisingly
neat
pleated
old
trousers
splattered
liberally
with
blood
centering
the
glassknife
his
right
hand
gazes
down
her
with
eyes
that
glitter
bright
the
metal
she
just
cut
and
his
smile
very
nearly
sharp
edged
cHello
little
one
the
man
says
Nassun
stares
cThat
quite
the
trick
Jija
tries
move
shifting
his
leg
along
the
harpoon
shaft
and
awful
There
the
abortive
sound
bone
grating
metal
and
groan
coughs
out
agonized
cry
grabbing
spasmodically
for
Nassun
Nassun
catches
his
shoulder
but
heavy
and
she
tired
and
she
realizes
sudden
horror
that
she
lacks
the
strength
fight
the
man
with
the
glassknife
that
should
necessary
Jija
shoulder
shakes
beneath
her
hand
and
she
shaking
nearly
hard
Maybe
this
why
one
uses
the
stuff
underneath
the
heat
Now
she
and
her
father
will
pay
the
price
for
her
folly
But
the
black
haired
man
hunkers
down
moving
with
remarkably
slow
grace
for
someone
who
showed
such
swift
brutality
only
moments
before
cDon
afraid
says
blinks
then
something
flickering
and
uncertain
his
gaze
cDo
know
you
Nassun
has
never
before
seen
this
giant
with
the
icewhite
eyes
and
the
world
longest
knife
The
knife
still
his
hand
though
now
dangles
his
side
dripping
She
shakes
her
head
little
too
hard
and
fast
The
man
blinks
the
uncertainty
clears
and
the
smile
returns
cThe
beasts
are
dead
came
help
you
didn
Something
off
about
the
question
asks
seeks
confirmation:
didn
too
sincere
too
heartfelt
somehow
Then
says
won
let
anyone
hurt
you
Perhaps
only
coincidence
that
his
gaze
slides
over
her
father
face
after
says
this
But
Something
Nassun
unclenches
just
little
Then
Jija
tries
move
again
and
makes
another
pained
sound
and
the
man
gaze
sharpens
cHow
unpleasant
Let
help
you
sets
down
the
knife
and
reaches
for
Jija
cStay
the
rust
back
Jija
blurts
trying
move
back
and
jerking
all
over
with
the
pain
this
panting
too
and
sweating
cWho
are
you
Are
you
His
eyes
roll
toward
the
flowing
ridge
hex
stone
cFrom
The
man
who
has
drawn
back
Jija
reaction
follows
his
gaze
cOh
Yes
The
comm
sentries
saw
you
coming
along
the
road
Then
saw
the
bandits
moving
came
help
had
trouble
with
that
lot
before
was
convenient
opportunity
eliminate
the
threat
His
white
gaze
shifts
back
Nassun
flicking
the
sheared
off
harpoon
along
the
way
has
never
stopped
smiling
cBut
you
should
not
have
had
trouble
with
them
knows
what
Nassun
She
cringes
against
her
father
though
she
knows
shelter
habit
Her
father
tenses
his
breath
quickening
rasp
cAre
are
you
swallows
cWe
looking
for
the
Moon
The
man
smile
widens
His
accent
something
Equatorial
Equatorials
always
have
such
strong
white
teeth
cAh
yes
says
cYou
found
Her
father
slumps
relief
the
degree
that
his
leg
allows
cOh
Evil
Earth
last
Nassun
can
take
anymore
cWhat
the
Moon
cFound
Moon
The
man
inclines
his
head
cThat
the
name
our
community
very
special
place
for
very
special
people
Then
sheaths
the
knife
and
extends
one
hand
palm
offering
cMy
name
Schaffa
The
hand
held
out
only
Nassun
and
Nassun
doesn
know
why
Maybe
because
knows
what
she
Maybe
only
because
her
hand
isn
covered
with
blood
both
Jija
are
She
swallows
and
takes
the
hand
which
immediately
and
firmly
closes
around
hers
She
manages
Nassun
That
father
She
lifts
her
chin
cNassun
Resistant
Tirimo
Nassun
knows
that
her
mother
was
trained
the
Fulcrum
which
means
that
Mama
use
name
was
never
cResistant
And
Nassun
only
ten
years
old
now
too
young
for
Tirimo
recognize
with
comm
name
even
she
still
lived
there
Yet
the
man
inclines
his
head
gravely
not
lie
cCome
then
says
cLet
see
between
the
two
can
get
your
father
free
rises
pulling
her
with
him
and
she
turns
toward
Jija
thinking
that
with
Schaffa
here
they
can
maybe
just
lift
Jija
off
the
shaft
and
that
they
fast
enough
maybe
won
hurt
him
too
much
But
before
she
can
open
her
mouth
say
this
Schaffa
presses
two
fingers
the
back
her
neck
She
flinches
and
rounds
him
instantly
defensive
and
raises
both
hands
wagging
the
fingers
show
that
still
unarmed
She
can
feel
bit
damp
her
neck
probably
smear
blood
cDuty
first
says
cWhat
nods
toward
her
father
can
lift
him
while
you
shift
the
leg
Nassun
blinks
again
confused
The
man
moves
over
Jija
and
she
distracted
from
wondering
about
that
strange
touch
her
father
cries
pain
they
work
him
free
Much
later
though
she
will
remember
instant
after
that
touch
when
the
tips
the
man
fingers
glimmered
like
the
cut
ends
the
harpoon
gossamer
thin
thread
light
under
the
heat
had
seemed
flicker
from
her
him
She
will
remember
too
that
for
moment
that
thread
light
illuminated
others:
whole
tracework
jagged
lines
spreading
all
over
him
like
the
spiderwebbing
that
follows
sharp
impact
brittle
glass
The
impact
site
the
center
the
spiderweb
was
somewhere
near
the
back
his
head
Nassun
will
remember
thinking
that
instant:
not
alone
there
the
moment
matter
Their
journey
has
ended
Nassun
apparently
home
