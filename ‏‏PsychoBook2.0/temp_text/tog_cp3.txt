The
force
that
shatters
the
Clalsu
orogeny
applied
air
Orogeny
isn
meant
applied
air
but
there
real
reason
for
not
work
Syenite
has
had
practice
already
using
orogeny
water
and
since
Allia
There
are
minerals
water
and
likewise
there
are
dust
particles
air
Air
has
heat
and
friction
and
mass
and
kinetic
potential
same
earth
the
molecules
air
are
simply
farther
apart
the
atoms
shaped
differently
Anyhow
the
involvement
obelisk
makes
all
these
details
academic
Schaffa
knows
what
coming
the
instant
feels
the
obelisk
pulse

Syenite

they
get
the
chance

knows
why

eyes
the
ground
and

has
seen
what
happens
when
four

that
how
still
thinks
Syenite

obelisk
does
genuinely
care
about
her
you
realize
(she
does
not

isn
all
about
control
She
his
little
one
and
has
protected
her
more
ways
than
she
knows
The
thought
her
agonizing
death
unbearable
him
This
ironic
considering
what
happens
next
the
moment
when
Syenite
stiffens
and
her
frame
becomes
suffused
with
light
and
the
air
within
the
Clalsu
tiny
forward
compartment
shivers
and
turns
into
nearly
solid
wall
unstoppable
force
Schaffa
happens
standing
one
side
hanging
bulkhead
rather
than
front
His
companion
the
Guardian
who
has
just
killed
Syenite
feral
lover
not
lucky:
When
the
force
slams
him
backward
the
bulkhead
juts
out
from
the
wall
just
the
right
height
and
angle
shear
his
head
off
before
giving
way
itself
Schaffa
however
flies
backward
unobstructed
through
the
Clalsu
capacious
hold
which
empty
because
the
ship
hasn
been
out
piracy
run
while
There
room
enough
for
his
velocity
slow
little
and
for
the
greatest
force
Syenite
blow
move
past
him
When
finally
does
hit
bulkhead
with
merely
bone
breaking
force
and
not
bone
pulverizing
force
And
the
bulkhead
buckling
crumbling
along
with
the
rest
the
ship
when
hits
That
helps
too
Then
when
jagged
knifelike
spikes
bedrock
from
the
ocean
floor
begin
spearing
through
the
explosion
debris
Schaffa
lucky
again:
None
them
pierce
his
body
Syenite
lost
the
obelisk
this
point
and
lost
the
first
throes
grief
that
will
send
aftershakes
through
even
Essun
life
(Schaffa
saw
her
hand

child

covering

Incomprehensible
Did
she
not

Schaffa

Something

This

Something
there

Ready
for
the
collapse

resistance

the
seducer
whisper
and
this
the

reasoning
Schaffa
has
used
himself

many
times
over
the
centuries
Justifying
too
many
atrocities

does

Schaffa
says
because
there
The
anger
and
whispers
within
him
have
purpose
after
all
and
this
has
become
his
purpose
Gather
them
train
them
make
them
the
weapons
they
are
meant
cIf
take
you
with
must
travel
far
from
here
You
never
see
your
family
again
The
boy
looks
away
his
expression
turning
bitter
cThey
kill
they
knew
cYes
Schaffa
presses
very
gently
and
draws
the
first
measure
something
from
the
boy
What
cannot
remember
what
called
Perhaps
has
name
All
that
matters
that
exists
and
needs
With
knows
somehow
can
hold
more
tightly

tattered
remnants

though
forces
himself
let
for
the
same
reason
can
endure
what
has
now
and
patient
the
boy
will
have
more
for
him
later
Yes
His
thoughts
are
clearer
now
Easier
think
around
the
whispers
needs
this
boy
and
others
like
him
must
forth
and
find
them
and
with
their
help
can
make
well
Not
everything
clearer
Some
things
will
never
come
back
make
The
boy
searching
his
face
While
Schaffa
has
been
trying
put
together
the
fragments
his
identity
the
boy
has
been
wrestling
with
his
future
They
are
made
for
each
other
with
you
the
boy
says
having
apparently
spent
the
past
minute
thinking
has
choice
cAnywhere
don
want
hurt
anyone
don
want
die
For
the
first
time
since
moment
ship
few
days
before
when
was
different
person
Schaffa
smiles
strokes
the
boy
head
again
cYou
have
good
soul
help
you
all
can
The
boy
tension
dissolves
once
tears
wet
his
eyes
cGo
and
gather
some
things
travel
speak
with
your
parents
These
words
fall
from
his
mouth
naturally
easily
has
said
them
before
though
doesn
remember
when
remembers
though
that
sometimes
things
don
well
says
they
will
The
boy
whispers
his
thanks
grabs
Schaffa
knee
and
tries
squeeze
that
thanks
into
him
then
trots
away
Schaffa
pushes
himself
slowly
his
feet
The
boy
has
left
the
faded
uniform
behind
Schaffa
pulls
this
again
his
fingers
remembering
how
the
seams
should
lie
There
should
cloak
too
but
that
gone
can
remember
where
When
steps
forward
mirror
the
side
the
room
catches
his
eye
and
stops
Shivers
not
pleasure
this
time
wrong
wrong
His
hair
hangs
lank
and
dry
after
the
sun
and
salt
ravaging
should
black
and
glossy
and
instead
dull
and
wispy
burnt
The
uniform
hangs
off
him
for
has
spent
some
the
substance
his
own
body

the
push
reach
shore
The
uniform
colors
are
also
wrong
and
there
reassurance
who
was
who
should
And
his
eyes
Evil
Earth
thinks
staring
the
icy
near
white
them
did
not
know
his
eyes
looked
like
this
There
creak
the
floorboards
near
the
door
and
his
alien
eyes
shift
one
side
The
boy
mother
stands
there
blinking
the
light
the
lantern
she
holds
cSchaffa
she
says

The

into

Schaffa

cTruly

cAnd
Eitz

Schaffa
smiles
reassure
her
For
some
reason
the

twitches
and
deepens
well
has
forgotten
how
charm
people
too
turns
and
goes
over
her
and
she
falls

his
approach
stops
amused
her
fear
cHe
too
has
learned
something
himself
taking
him
away
now
The

widen
Her
mouth
works

for

then
she
sets
her

She
swallows
her

tightening
the
little
lantern

with
whatever
emotion
flashes
through
her
cDon
take
him
Please
Schaffa
tilts
his
head
cWhy
not
cIt
would
kill
his
father
cNot
his
grandfather
Schaffa
takes
step
closer
(Closer
cNot
his
uncles
and
aunts
and
cousins
Not
you
She
twitches
again
don
know
how
feel
right
now
She
shakes
her
head
cPoor
poor
thing
Schaffa
says
softly
This
compassion
automatic
too
feels
the
sorrow
deeply
cBut
will
you
protect
him
from

take
him
cWhat
She
looks
Schaffa
surprise
and
alarm
Can
this
truly
have
never
occurred
her
Apparently
not
cProtect
him
That
she
asks
this
Schaffa
understands
the
proof
that
she
inadequate
the
task
sighs
and
reaches
put
hand
her
shoulder
and
shakes
his
head
convey
regret
She
relaxes
minutely
and
does
not
notice
when
his
hand
instead
curves
around
her
neck
His
fingers
settle
into
place
and
she
stiffens
once
cWh
Then
she
falls
down
dead
Schaffa
blinks
she
falls
the
floor
For
moment
confused
Was
that
supposed
happen
And
then
his
own
thoughts
freshened
further
the
dollop
something
that
she
has
given
him
such
tiny
amount
relative
what
Eitz
possessed
understands
This
thing
only
safe
with
orogenes
who
have
more
than
enough
share
The
woman
must
have
been
still
But
Schaffa
feels
better
fact
Take
more
whispers
the
rage
the
back
his
mind
Take
the
others
They
threaten
the
boy
which
threatens
you
Yes
That
seems
wise
Schaffa
rises
and
moves
through
the
quiet
dark
house
touching
each
member
Eitz

devouring

Most
