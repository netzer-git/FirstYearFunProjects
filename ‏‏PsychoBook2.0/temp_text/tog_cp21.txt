Outside
there

One

The
fighting
mostly
over
however
because
two
things
First
the
invaders
have
realized
they
are
trapped
between
the
insect
infested
surface
and
their
enemies
who
are
greater

invading
army

Those
who
wish
live
have
surrendered
those
who
fear
worse
death

The
second
thing
that
has
stopped
the
fighting
the
inescapable
fact
that
