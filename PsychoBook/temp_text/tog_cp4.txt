TIRED
AFTER
CALLING
THE
OBELISK
When
you
get
back
your
room
and
stretch
out
for
half
moment
the
bare
pallet
that
came
with
the
apartment
you
fall
asleep
fast
you
don
even
realize
you
doing
the
dead
the
night
your
body
clock
says
since
the
glowing
walls
haven
changed
your
eyes
blink
open
and
like
only
moment
has
passed
But
Hoa
curled
beside
you
apparently
actually
sleeping
for
once
and
you
can
hear
Tonkee
snoring
faintly
the
room
next
door
and
you
feel
much
better
than
you
did
hungry
Well
rested
for
perhaps
the
first
time
weeks
The
hunger
spurs
you
and
into
the
apartment
living
room
There
small
hempen
satchel
the
table
which
Tonkee
must
acquired
partially
open
reveal
mushrooms
and
small
pile
dried
beans
and
other
cachefood
That
right:
accepted
members
Castrima
you
now
get
share
the
comm
stores
None
the
kind
food
you
can
just
eat
for
snack
except
maybe
the
mushrooms
but
you
never
seen
those
before
and
some
varieties
mushrooms
need
cooked
edible
You
tempted
but
Castrima
the
sort
comm
that
would
give
dangerous
foodstuffs
newcomers
without
warning
them
Hmm
Right
You
fetch
your
runny
sack
rummage
for
the
remaining
provisions
you
brought
Castrima
with
you
and
make
meal
out
dried
oranges
cachebread
crusts
and
lump
bad
tasting
jerky
that
you
traded
for
the
last
comm
you
passed
and
which
you
suspect
hydro
pipe
rat
meat
Food
that
which
nourishes
the
lorists
say
You
just
choked
the
jerky
down
and
are
sitting
there
sleepily
pondering
how
merely
summoning
obelisk
took
much
out
you
anything
regarding
the
obelisks
can
described
with
the
adjective
merely
when
you
become
aware
high
rhythmic
scraping
sound
outside
You
dismiss
immediately
Nothing
about
this
comm
makes
sense
will
probably
take
you
weeks
not
months
get
used
its
peculiar
sounds
(Months
Are

sound

louder
and
closer

you
keep
yawning

you

when
belatedly
dawns
you

what
you

the

passes
right
your

big
basket
the
same
mushrooms
you
almost
ate
she
nods
you
distractedly
you
come
out
then
almost
loses
her
load
she
tries
turn
toward
the
noise
and
nearly
bumps
into
man
pushing

that
stinks

and
probably
from
the
latrines

Castrima
effectively
never
sleeps
and
you
know
they
have
six
work
shifts
instead
the
usual
three
because
you
been

Castrima
folk
say
when
you
supposed
look
for
some
woman
named
Artith
near
the
forge
And
none
this
relevant
because
through
the
scatter
and
jut
Castrima
crystals
you
can
see
small
cluster
people
coming
into
the
big
rectangular
tunnel

that
serves
the
entrance
the
geode
They
running
and
they

Then
someone
shouts

And
the

that
you
twitch
You
can

Something
about

Regardless

You
out
the

and
running
for
the
ground
level
the
next
breath
almost
before
you
thought
about

Such
monster
you
are
Castrima
frustratingly
confusing
always
but
this
time
you

fact
that

and

time

get
there
small
crowd
has
formed
around
the
infirmary
most
the
people
milling
about
curiosity
concern
anxiety
Lerna
and
the
cluster
people
carrying
their
injured
companion
have
gone
inside
and
the
awful
screech
obvious
now
for
what
is:
the
throat
tearing
howl
someone
appalling

who
nevertheless
somehow
forced

that
you
start
pushing
forward
get
inside
You
know
nothing
about
giving
medical
care
but
you
know
pain
your
surprise
though
people
glance
you
annoyance
then
blink
and
shift
aside
You
notice
those
who
look
blank
being
pulled
aside
for
quick
whispers
those
whose
eyes
have
widened
Castrima
been
talking
about
you
Then
you
inside
the
infirmary
and
you
nearly
get
knocked
down
Sanzed
woman
running
past
with
some
sort
syringe
her
hands
Can
safe
that
You
follow
her
over
infirmary
bed
where
six
people
hold
down
the
person
doing
the
screaming
You
get
look
the
person
face
when
one
them
shifts
aside:
one
you
know
Just
another
Midlatter
man
who
has
clearly
been
topside
judge
the
gray
layer
ash
his
skin
and
clothing
and
hair
The
woman
with
the
syringe
shoulders
aside
someone
else
and
ostensibly
administers
the
syringe
contents
moment
later
the
man
shudders
all
over
and
his
mouth
begins
close
His
scream
dies
off
slowly
slowly
Slowly
jerks
once
mightily
his
holders
all
shift
with
the
strength
his
effort
Then
last
mercifully
subsides
into
unconsciousness
The
silence
almost
reverberates
Lerna
and
the
Sanzed
healer
keep
moving
though
the
people
who
have
been
holding
the
man
down
draw
back
and
look
each
other
asking
what
now
the
now
silent
confusion
you
cannot
help
glancing
off
toward
the
far
end
the
infirmary
where
Alabaster
still
sits
unnoticed
the
infirmary
new
guests
His
stone
eater
stands
where
you
last
saw
her
though
her
gaze
also
fixed
the
tableau
You
can
see
Alabaster
face
over
the
beds
his
eyes
slide
over
meet
yours
but
then
they
shift
away
Your
attention
recaptured
the
man
the
bed
some
the
people
around
him
step
back
first
you
can
tell
what
the
problem
other
than
that
his
pants
seem
oddly
wet
patches
caked
with
muddy
ash
The
wetness
isn
red
not
blood
but
there

not
sure

What
you
notice
first
peels
away
the
damp
cloth
are
the
small
round
blue
hemispheres
that
dot
the

here

there

That

they
look
like

blue

who

off
the
door
She
comes
stand
beside
you
and
you
look
over
Ykka
whose
eyes
widen
confusion
and
revulsion
for
instant
before
she
schools
her
expression

Then
she
says
sharply

freeze
over
Its
legs

had
been
hooked
into

around
pop
loose

But
then
you
hear
soft

the

dissipates
You
look
over

that
Alabaster

You
see
the

there
and
start
shake
your
head:
you
did
not
freeze
the

But
that
isn
the

You

the

never

cThe

registers
your

that

that

you
and
all

you
realize
that
his
placid
manner
has
been
concealing
absolute
rage
His
gaze
cool

visible
everything

open

cuts
himself
off
with

turning

sharply
You
stare
his
tense
back
and
say
nothing
because
there
nothing
you
can
say
This
the
