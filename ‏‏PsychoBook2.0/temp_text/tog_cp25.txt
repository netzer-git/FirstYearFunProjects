and
you
then
and
now
noindent
Let
end
with
the
beginning
the
world
why
don
One
beginning
among
many
well
Two:
the
first
here
and
now
the
second
there
and
then
The
now
now
The
here:
cavern
beneath
vast
ancient
shield
volcano
Its
heart
you
prefer
and
have
sense
metaphor
not
this
deep
dark
barely
stable
vesicle
amid
rock
that
has
not
cooled
much
the
thirty
thousand
years
gone
since
Father
Earth
first
burped
Millennia
worth
additional
rock
spilled
forth
lava
and
cooling
and
then
turn
buried
the
next
lava
flow
insulates
against
heat
loss
Within
this
cavern
stand
partially
fused
with
hump
rock
that
may
better
watch
for
the
minute
perturbations
major
deformations
that
presage
collapse
don
need
this
There
are
few
processes
more
unstoppable
than
the
one
have
set
motion
here
Still
understand
what
alone
left
alone
when
you
are
confused
and
afraid
and
unsure
what
will
happen
next
understand
that
sometimes
keeping
watch
not
merely
about
protection
about
standing
witness
Standing
together
Offering
guidance
where
needed
care
where
not
Making
sure
you
have
everything
you
need
you
Hello
you
Now
Let
review
You
were
once
the
Fulcrum
one
the
feared
Imperial
Orogenes
sent
forth
work
the
earth
for
Mother
Sanze
One
the
good
ones
the
stills
thought
you
one
the
controlled
ones
unlikely
wipe
out
town
accident
Joke
them
right
How
many
towns
have
you
wiped
out
now
many
Sometimes
you
dream
undoing
all
somehow
Not
reaching
for
the
garnet
obelisk
Allia
and
instead
bleeding
out
while
watching
laughing
black
children
play
the
surf
nearby
Not
going
Meov
instead
returning
the
Fulcrum
give
birth
Corundum
you
would
have
lost
him
after
that
birth
when
the
Guardians
took
him
away
some
unknown
fate
and
you
would
never
have
had
Innon
but
both
them
would
probably
alive
And
then
you
would
never
have
lived
Tirimo
never
borne
Uche
die
beneath
his
father
fists
never
have
half
smashed
the
town
when
they
tried
kill
you
many
lives
saved
you
had
only
stayed
your
cage
Well
Too
late
now
You
are
who
you
are
And
here
now
you
are
Essun
who
has
saved
the
comm
Castrima
the
cost
Castrima
itself
You
are
the
second
person
open
the
Obelisk
Gate
age
and
doing
unleash
the
concatenated
power
machine
older
than
written
history
Since
the
process
learning
master
this
power
you
accidentally
murdered
Alabaster
Tenring
this
makes
you
the
most
powerful
orogene
the
planet
also
means
that
your
tenure
the
most
powerful
orogene
has
just
acquired
expiration
date
because
the
same
thing
happening
you
that
happened
Alabaster
near
the
end:
You
turning
stone
Just
the
arm
for
now
Could
worse
Will
worse
the
next
time
you
open
the
Gate
even
the
next
time
you
wield
enough
the
strange
silvery
not
orogeny
called
magic
Good
thing
one
Castrima
realizes
this
the
way
They
think
you
can
help
them
which
the
only
reason
they
bringing
you
along
because
you
also
the
reason
they
homeless
They
glare
and
mutter
you
lie
the
coma
that
swallowed
you
after
you
sealed
half
dozen
murderous
stone
eaters
into
proto
obelisks
and
doing
disrupted
delicate
technology
thousands
years
beyond
anyone
ability
repair
They
would
have
words
for
you
you
were
awake
hear
them
Instead
you
lie
dreaming
family
envy
your
comfort
even
pity
you
will
not
last
You
got
job
after
all
The
one
you
have
the
easier
the
two:
just
catch
the
Moon
Seal
and
shut
down
the
Yumenes
Rifting
Reduce
the
current
Season
impact
from
thousands
years
back
down
something
manageable
Something
the
human
race
has
chance
surviving
The
job
you
want
getting
Nassun
your
daughter
back
from
her
murderous
father
About
that:
have
good
news
and
bad
news
Essun
apocalypse
relative
thing
isn
When
the
earth
shatters
disaster
creatures
that
depend
plants
and
meat
and
clean
water
and
cool
fresh
air
survive
but
nothing
much
the
earth
itself
When
man
dies
should
devastating
the
girl
who
once
called
him
father
but
becomes
nothing
girl
who
has
been
called
monster
many
times
that
she
finally
embraces
the
label
When
slave
rebels
nothing
much
the
people
who
read
about
later
Just
thin
words
thinner
paper
sliced
finer
still
the
distance
history
cSo
you
were
slaves
what
whisper
distance
and
denial
the
people
who
live
both
those
who
took
their
dominance
for
granted
until
comes
for
them
the
dark
with
knife
and
those
who
would
see
the
world
burn
before
enduring
one
moment
more
cinferiority
That
was
not
metaphor
Essun
Not
hyperbole
have
watched
the
world
burn
Say
nothing
lost
innocents
unearned
suffering
When
comm
builds
atop
faultline
you
blame
its
walls
for
crushing
the
people
inside
when
they
inevitably
crumble
Some
worlds
are
built
upon
faultline
pain
held
stable
temporarily
nightmare
walls
Don
lament
when
they
fall
apart
Lament
that
they
were
ever
built
the
first
place
Well
That
enough
segue
Now
let
talk
about
then:
the
end
the
last
world
which
was
the
beginning
this
one
want
you
imagine
what
the
world
was
like
before
the
Seasons
This
will
unimaginable
for
you
know
You
have
point
reference
The
Stillness
scar
not
land
Season
after
Fifth
Season
has
scoured
its
face
seamed
with
old
burns
badly
healed
lacerations
ulcerated
sores
The
Nomidlats
are
much
larger
now
than
they
were
did
you
know
Palela
the
sleepy
town
where
little
Damaya
Strongback
discovered
what
she
was
and
lost
her
family
sits
land
that
did
not
exist
youth
spilled
out
the
boundary
between
the
Minimal
and
Maximal
once
finally
cooled
watched
change
from
barren
shatterland
new
forest
over
less
than
century
farmland
now
but
remember
when
was
floodplain
lava
that
stretched
far
the
eye
could
see
And
before
that
was
city
was
born
there
Hmm
seem
have
forgotten
its
name
Perhaps
you
think
that
odd
The
time
that
spent
the
garnet
obelisk
was
good
some
respects
remember
some
where
most
the
others
the
old
ones
like
recall
none
few
have
even
forgotten
that
used
well
you
That
the
core
many
problems
our
minds
remained
human
even
the
rest
changed
outlive
our
selves
But
names
was
never
good
with
names
even
when
the
memories
were
fresh
Well
Names
are
irrelevant
make
them
feel
you
need
them
imagine
again
and
then
imagine
farther
Massive
cities
sprawling
along
every
coastline
brimful
the
wealthy
and
the
powerful
yes
those
days
only
unfortunates
lived
inland
Forests
and
plains
more
green
and
tender
than
anything
you
ever
seen
Trees
that
would
never
survive
single
ashfall
absurd
their
design
compared
the
tough
compact
thick
skinned
flora
today
but
beautiful
sky
deeply
blue
and
clear
that
you
stared
long
enough
you
could
see
where
bled
into
space
(Space
Worlds
beyond
the
world
Imagine
looking
and
caring
about
what
you
see
And
imagine
too
great
white
eye
gazing
back
you
from
the
midst
that
nighttime
blackness
But
why
does
this
thought
frighten
you
Instead
the
void
another
presence
Would
not
good
feel
less
lonely
remember
all
this
though
the
memory
thin
and
curls
about
the
edges
remember
with
the
clarity
one
who
stared
endlessly
hungrily
through
glass
remember
the
day
that
started
The
person
The
event
will
tell
you
the
way
that
world
ended
will
tell
you
how
rusting
killed
least
enough
that
had
start
over
and
rebuild
itself
from
scratch
will
tell
you
how
opened
the
Gate
and
flung
away
the
Moon
and
laughed
did
And
how
the
quiet
death
descended
