PICK
your
household
share
for
the
week
when
you
hear
the
first
whisper
not
directed
you
and
not
meant
overheard
but
you
hear
anyway
because
the
speaker
agitated
and
forgets
quiet
cToo
Earthfired

But
the

The
man
shushed
his
companion
once
You
fix
your
gaze
distant
group
people
trying
haul
some
baskets
mineral
ore
across
the
cavern
use
guided
ropeslide
that
when
the
younger
man
looks
around
won
see
you
looking
them
But
you
remember
been
week
since
the
incident
with
the
boilbugs
and
feels
like
month
This
isn
just
losing
track
days
and
nights
Some
the
strange
elasticity
time
comes
from
your
having
lost
Nassun
and
with
her
the
urgency
purpose
Without
that
purpose
you
feel
sort
attenuated
and
loose
aimless
compass
needles
must
have
been
during
the
Wandering
Season
You
decided
try
settling
recentering
your
awareness
exploring
your
new
boundaries
but
that
isn
helping
much
Castrima
geode
defies
your
sense
size
well
time
feels
cluttered
when
you
stand
near
one
the
geode
walls
where
the
view
the
opposite
wall
occluded
dozens
jagged
crisscrossing
quartz
shafts
feels
empty
when
you
pass
entire
crystals
worth
unoccupied
apartments
and
realize
the
place
was
built
hold
many
more
people
than
currently
does
The
trading
post
the
surface
was
smaller
than
Tirimo
yet
you
beginning
realize
that
Ykka
efforts
recruitment
for
Castrima
have
been
exceptionally
successful
least
half
the
people
you
meet
the
comm
are
new
same
you
(No
wonder
she
wanted
some
new
people
her
improvised
advising
council
newness
group
trait
here
You
meet
nervous
metallorist
and
three
knappers
who
are
nothing
like
Jija
biomest
who
works
with
Lerna
two
days
week
and
woman
who
once
made
living
selling
artful
leather
crafts
gifts
who
now
spends
her
days
tanning
skins
that
the
Hunters
bring
Some
the
new
people
have
bitter
look
because
like
Lerna
they
did
not
intend
join
Castrima
Ykka
someone
else
deemed
them
useful
community
that
once
consisted
solely
traders
and
miners
and
that
meant
the
end
their
journey
Some
them
however
are
palpably
feverish
their
determination
contribute
and
defend
the
comm
These
are
the
ones
who
had
nowhere
their
comms
destroyed
the
Rifting
the
aftershakes
Not
all
them
have
useful
skills
They
youngish
usually
which
makes
sense
because
most
comms
won
take
people
who
are
elderly
infirm
during
Season
unless
they
have
very
desirable
skills
and
because
you
learn
upon
talking
with
them
Ykka
demands
that
very
specific
question
put
most
newcomers:
Can
you
live
with
orogenes
The
ones
who
say
yes
get
come
The
ones
who
can
say
yes
tend
younger
(The
ones
who
say
you
understand
without
having
ask
are
not
permitted
travel
onward
and
potentially
join
other
comms
commless
bands
attack
community
that
knowingly
harbors
orogenes
There
convenient
gypsum
quarry
not
far
off
apparently
which
downwind
Helps
draw
scavengers
away
from
Castrima
over
too
And
then
there
are
the
natives
the
people
who
were
part
Castrima
long
before
the
Season
began
lot
them
are
unhappy
about
all
the
new
additions
even
though
everyone
knows
the
comm
couldn
have
survived
was
was
simply
too
small
Before
Lerna
they
had
doctor
only
man
who
did
midwifery
field
surgery
and
livestock
medicine
sideline
his
farrier
business
And
they
had
only
two
orogenes
Ykka
and
Cutter
though
apparently
one
knew
for
sure
that
Cutter
was
one
until
the
start
the
Season
now
there
story
you
want
hear
someday
Without
orogenes
Castrima
under
becomes
deathtrap
which
makes
most
the
natives
reluctantly
willing
accept
Ykka
efforts
attract
more
her
kind
the
old
Castrimans
look
you
with
suspicion
but
the
good
thing
that
they
look
all
the
newcomers
the
same
way
not
your
status
orogene
that
bothers
them
that
you
haven
yet
proven
yourself
(It
surprising
how
refreshing
this
feels
Being
judged
what
you
and
not
what
you
are
Lately
you
spent
your
mornings
work
crew
doing
water
gardening:
sprouting
seeds
trays
wet
cloth
then
moving
the
resulting
seedlings
troughs
water
and
chemicals
that
the
biomests
devise
that
they
can
grow
soothing
work
and
reminds
you
the
housegreen
you
had
back
Tirimo
(Uche
sitting
amid
the
edible
ferns
making
horrible
faces
chewed
mouthful
dirt
before
you
could
stop
him
You
smile
this
memory
before
the
hurt
blanks
your
face
again
You
still
can
smile
over
things
Corundum
did
and
that
been
ten
eleven
years
now
the
evenings
you
Ykka
talk
with
her
and
Lerna
and
Hjarka
and
Cutter
about
the
affairs
the
comm
This
includes
stuff
like
whether
punish
Jever
Innovator
Castrima
for
selling
fans
since
market
economies
are
illegal
during
Season
per
Imperial
Law
and
how
stop
Old
Man
Crey
(who
isn
that
old
from
complaining
again
that
the
communal
baths
are
too
tepid
getting
everyone
nerves
And
who
going
step
Ontrag
the
potter
keeps
breaking
the
bad
practice
pottery
the
two
people
apprenticed
her
how
Ontrag
was
taught
but
that
also
how
one
teaches
people
who
want
learn
pottery
Ontrag
apprentices
are
only
there
because
Ykka
ordered
them
learn
the
old
woman
skill
before
she
kicks
off
the
rate
things
are
going
they
might
kill
her
themselves
ridiculous
mundane
incredibly
tedious
stuff
and
you
love
Why
Who
knows
Perhaps
because
similar
the
sorts
discussions
you
had
back
during
the
two
times
you
were
part
family
You
remember
arguing
with
Innon
about
whether
teach
Corundum
Sanze
mat
early
wouldn
have
accent
later
and
only
Coru
ever
wanted
leave
Meov
You
had
argument
with
Jija
once
because
believed
putting
fruit
the
cold
cache
ruined
the
taste
and
you
didn
care
because
made
the
fruit
last
longer
The
arguments
that
you
have
with
the
other
advisors
are
more
important:
Your
decisions
affect
more
than
thousand
people
now
But
they
have
the
same
silly
pedantic
feel
Silly
pedantry
luxury
that
you
rarely
been
able
enjoy
your
life
You
gone
topside
again
standing
silent
the
porch
gateway
house
the
falling
ash
The
sky
little
different
today:
thinnish
gray
yellow
instead
thickish
gray
red
and
the
pattern
the
clouds
long
and
wavelike
lieu
the
chains
beads
you
seen
since
the
Rifting
One
the
Strongback
guards
says
looking
cMaybe
things
are
getting
better
The
yellow
the
clouds
almost
feels
like
sunlight
You
can
see
the
sun
itself
now
and
again
pale
and
strengthless
disc
occasionally
framed
the
gentle
drifting
curves
You
don
tell
the
guard
what
you
can
sess
which
that
the
yellow
clouds
contain
more
sulfur
than
usual
Nor
you
say
what
you
know
which
that
rains
right
now
the
forest
that
surrounds
Castrima
and
currently
provides
significant
portion
the
comm
food
will
die
Somewhere
north
the
rift
that
Alabaster
tore
has
simply
belched
out
great
waft
the
gas
from
some
long
buried
underground
pocket
Cutter
who
come
here
with
you
and
Hjarka
glances
you
face
carefully
blank
knows
too
But
doesn
say
anything
either
and
you
think
you
know
why:
Because
the
guard
and
his
wistful
hope
that
things
are
getting
better
would
cruel
break
that
hope
before
fades
its
own
You
like
Cutter
better
for
this
moment
shared
kindness
Then
you
turn
your
head
little
and
the
feeling
vanishes
There
another
stone
eater
nearby
lurking
the
shadows
house
not
far
off
This
one
male
ish
butter
yellow
marble
laced
with
veins
brown
with
swirling
cap
brass
hair
isn
looking
anyone
isn
moving
and
you
wouldn
have
even
noticed
him
not
for
the
bright
metal
his
hair
striking
against
the
haze
the
day
You
wonder
for
the
third
fourth
time
why
they
cluster
around
Castrima
Are
they
trying
help
Hoa
helps
you
Are
they
expecting
more
you
turn
delicious
chewable
stone
Are
they
just
bored
You
can
deal
with
these
creatures
You
push
Butter
Marble
from
your
mind
and
look
away
and
later
when
you
ready
set
off
and
you
glance
that
way
again
gone
The
three
you
are
here
following
one
the
Hunters
through
the
forest
because
they
want
you
come
and
see
something
Ykka
not
along
for
the
trip
because
she
mediating
dispute
between
the
Strongbacks
and
the
Resistants
about
shift
length
something
Lerna
not
here
because
started
teaching
wound
care
anyone
who
wants
attend
Hoa
not
here
because
Hoa
still
missing
has
been
for
the
past
week
But
with
you
are
seven
the
Castrima
Strongbacks
two
Hunters
and
the
blond
white
woman
you
met
your
first
day
Castrima
who
has
since
introduced
herself
Esni
She
been
accepted
into
the
comm
Strongback
despite
being
barely
over
hundred
pounds
and
paler
than
ash
Turns
out
she
was
the
head
drover
clan
before
the
Rifting
which
means
she
knows
how
wrangle
large
animals
and
people
with
outsized
egos
She
and
her
people
voluntarily
joined
Castrima
because
was
much
closer
than
their
home
comm
down
the
Antarctics
The
air
dried
pickled
salt
cured
remnants
their
last
cattle
herd
have
constituted
Castrima
only
meat
stores
since
the
Rifting
one
talks
you
walk
The
silence
the
forest
save
for
the
rustling
small
creatures
through
the
undergrowth
and
the
occasional
tap
tap
wood
boring
animals
the
distance
demands
more
the
same
The
woods
are
changing
you
see
you
tromp
through
them
The
taller
trees
lost
their
leaves
months
ago
sap
drawing
down
protect
against
the
encroaching
cold
and
the
souring
surface
soil
But
correspondingly
the
shrubs
and
mid
level
trees
have
grown
thicker
foliage
drinking
what
little
light
they
can
capture
sometimes
folding
their
leaves
down
night
shed
ash
This
makes
the
ash
thinner
off
the
roads
much
that
you
can
sometimes
see
the
ground
litter
Which
good
because
makes
the
newest
parts
the
landscape
stand
out
that
much
more:
the
mounds
They
three
four
feet
high
usually
built
cemented
ash
and
leaves
and
twigs
and
brighter
day
like
this
they
are
easy
spot
because
they
steam
faintly
Occasionally
you
see
small
bones
the
remains
paws
tails
poking
through
the
base
each
mound
Boilbug
nests
Not
many
but
you
don
remember
any
week
ago
when
you
walked
past
this
area
the
forest
(You
would
sessed
the
heat
reminder
that
while
most
plants
and
animals
struggle
survive
Season
rare
few
more:
deprived
their
usual
predators
and
given
ideal
conditions
they
thrive
breeding
wildly
wherever
they
can
find
food
source
relying
numbers
ensure
the
species
continuation
Not
good
regardless
You
find
yourself
checking
your
shoes
frequently
and
you
notice
the
others
doing
the
same
Then
you
reached
the
top
ridge
that
overlooks
spreading
forest
basin
clear
the
basin
outside
the
zone
protection
that
Castrima
orogenes
maintain
because
broad
swaths
the
forest
here
are
flattened
and
dead
the
aftermath
the
Rifting
You
able
see
hundreds
miles
not
for
the
ash
but
since
this
such
bright
low
ash
day
you
can
see
perhaps
few
dozen
enough
Because
there
hazy
the
golden
light
you
can
see
something
standing
above
the
flattened
forest:
cluster
what
must
stripped
saplings
long
branches
set
into
the
ground
attempt
straightness
although
many
them
list
one
side
the
other
the
tip
each
flapping
bit
dark
red
cloth
draw
the
eye
You
can
tell
whether
the
red
dye
something
else
because
mounted
each
these
stakes
body
The
stakes
jut
from
the
bodies
mouths
other
parts
they
are
impaled
upon
them
cNot
our
people
says
Hjarka
She
looking
through
distance
glass
adjusting
while
one
the
Hunters
hovers
nearby
hands
half
upraised
catch
the
precious
instrument
should
Hjarka
fumble
knowing
Hjarka
toss
the
thing
away
mean
hard
tell
from
this
distance
but
don
recognize
them
and
don
think
ever
sent
anyone
out
that
far
And
they
look
filthy
Commless
band
maybe
cOne
that
bit
off
more
than
could
chew
mutters
one
the
Hunters
cAll
our
patrols
are
accounted
for
says
Esni
folding
her
arms
don
keep
track
anybody
but
the
Strongbacks
mean
the
Hunters
their
own
thing
but
note
goings
and
comings
She
already
studied
the
bodies
through
the
distance
glass
and
was
her
call
that
members
the
comm
leadership
brought
topside
see
for
themselves
figure
the
culprits
are
travelers
late
group
trying
make
back
home
comm
better
armed
than
the
commless
who
attacked
them
And
luckier
cTravelers
wouldn
this
says
Cutter
quietly
usually
quiet
Hjarka
the
one
you
always
expect
difficult
but
she
actually
predictable
and
far
more
easygoing
than
her
fierce
appearance
would
suggest
Cutter
though
opposes
nearly
everything
you
Ykka
the
others
suggest
stubborn
little
ruster
under
that
quiet
demeanor
cThe
impaling
mean
reason
stop
for
that
long
Someone
spent
time
cutting
down
those
poles
sharpening
them
digging
holes
post
them
positioning
them
they
could
seen
for
miles
around
Travelers
travel
Cutter
much
harder
read
than
Hjarka
too
you
notice
now
Hjarka
woman
who
has
never
been
able
hide
the
breadth
and
vigor
what
she
she
doesn
bother
try
Cutter
man
who
spent
his
life
concealing
the
strength
mountains
behind
veneer
meekness
Now
you
know
what
that
looks
like
from
the
outside
But
got
point
cWhat
you
think
then
You
guess
wildly
cAnother
commless
band
cThey
wouldn
this
either
this
point
they
not
wasting
bodies
anymore
You
wince
and
see
several
other
people
the
group
sigh
shift
But
true
There
are
still
animals
hunt
but
the
ones
that
aren
hibernating
are
fierce
enough
armored
enough
toxic
enough
costly
prey
for
anything
but
very
well
prepared
hunters
Commless
rarely
have
good
working
crossbows
and
desperation
makes
for
poor
stealth
And
the
boilbugs
have
shown
there
new
competition
for
any
carcasses
course
Castrima
doesn
find
new
source
meat
soon
you
and
the
others
won
wasting
bodies
anymore
either
That
wince
served
many
purposes
Hjarka
lowers
the
distance
glass
last
cYeah
she
sighs
responding
Cutter
cFuck
cWhat
You
feel
stupid
suddenly
everyone
has
started
speaking
another
language
cSomebody
marking
territory
Hjarka
gestures
with
the
distance
glass
shrugging
the
Hunter
deftly
plucks
from
her
hand
cDoing
this
warn
off
but
not
other
commless
who
don
give
shit
and
will
probably
just
pull
the
bodies
down
for
snacks
Letting
know
what
they
cross
their
boundaries
cOnly
comm
that
direction
Tettehee
says
one
the
Hunters
cThey
friendly
have
been
for
years
And
threat
them
Not
much
water
that
direction
support
other
comms
the
river
wends
away
the
north
North
That
bothers
you
You
don
know
why
There
reason
mention
this
the
others
but
still
cWhen
the
last
time
you
heard
from
this
Tettehee
Silence
greets
you
and
you
look
around
Everyone
staring
Well
that
answers
that
cWe
need
send
somebody
Tettehee
then
Somebody
who
might
end
pole
Hjarka
glares
you
cNobody
expendable
this
comm
newcomer
the
first
time
you
ever
sparked
her
ire
and
lot
ire
She
older
bigger
and
addition
her
sharpened
teeth
there
her
glare
which
black
eyed
and
fierce
But
she
reminds
you
somehow
Innon
you
feel
anything
but
anger
response
cWe
going
need
send
out
trading
party
anyway
You
say
gently
you
can
which
makes
her
blink
That
the
inevitable
conclusion
all
the
talks
you
had
lately
about
the
comm
deepening
meat
deficit
cWe
might
well
use
this
warn
off
make
sure
that
party
armed
and
large
enough
group
that
one
can
tackle
them
without
paying
for
cAnd
whoever
did
this
has
larger
better
armed
group
never
just
about
strength
during
Season
You
know
that
Hjarka
knows
that
But
you
say
cSend
orogene
with
them
She
blinks
genuine
surprise
then
lifts
eyebrow
cWho
kill
half
our
people
trying
defend
them
You
turn
away
from
her
and
hold
out
hand
None
them
move
away
from
you
but
then
none
them
are
from
comms
large
enough
have
been
visited
often
Imperial
Orogenes
they
don
know
what
your
gesture
means
They
gasp
though
and
move
back
and
murmur
when
you
spin
five
foot
wide
torus
the
brush
few
paces
away
Ash
and
dead
leaves
swirl
into
dust
devil
glittering
with
ice
the
sulfurous
afternoon
light
You
didn
have
spin
that
fast
You
just
being
dramatic
Then
you
use
what

distance
impossible
tell
what
happening
first
but
then
the
trees
the
area
shiver
and
the
poles
begin
sway
wildly
moment
later
fissure
opens
and
you
drop
the
poles
and
their
grisly
ornaments
into
the
ground
You
pull
your
hands
together
slowly
not
alarm
anyone
and
the
trees
stop
shivering
But
moment
later
everyone
feels
the
faint
judder
the
ridge
you
standing
because
you
let
little
the
aftershake
come
this
way
Again
you
didn
have
You
just
had
point
make
commendable
that
Hjarka
just
looks
impressed
and
not
alarmed
when
you
open
your
eyes
and
turn
her
cNice
she
says
cSo
you
can
ice
someone
without
killing
everyone
around
you
But
every
rogga
could
that
people
wouldn
have
problem
with
roggas
You
really
hate
that
rusting
word
matter
what
Ykka
thinks
And
you
not
sure
you
agree
with
Hjarka
assessment
People
have
problems
with
roggas
for
lot
reasons
that
have
nothing
with
orogeny
You
open
your
mouth
reply
and
then
stop
Because
now
you
can
see
the
trap
Hjarka
set
the
only
way
this
conversation
going
end
and
you
don
want
there

Alabaster
says
You
sigh
know
the
next
day
and
another
conversation
about
the
principles
the
unreal
how
obelisk
works
how
their
crystalline
structure
emulates
the
strange
linkages
power
between
the
cells
living
being
and
how
there
are
theories
about
things
even
smaller
than
cells
somehow
even
though
one
has
seen
them
can
prove
that
they
exist
You
have
these
conversations
with
Alabaster
every
day
between
your
morning
work
shift
and
evening
politicking
because
filled
with
sense
urgency
spurred
his
own
impending
mortality
The
sessions
don
last
long
because
Alabaster
has
limited
strength
And
the
conversations
far
haven
been
very
useful
mostly
because
Alabaster
terrible
teacher
barks
orders
and
gives
lectures
never
answering
your
questions
when
you
ask
them
impatient
and
snappish
And
while
some
this
can
chalked
the
pain
that
the
rest
just
Alabaster
being
himself
really
hasn
changed
You
are
frequently
surprised
how
much
you
missed
him
the
irascible
old
ass
And
because
this
you
hold
your
temper
for
while
anyway
cSomeone
got
teach
the
younger
ones
anyway
you
say
Most
the
comm
orogenes
are
children
adolescents
simply
because
most
ferals
don
survive
childhood
You
heard
rumors
that
some
the
older
orogenes
are
teaching
them
helping
them
learn
not
ice
things
when
they
stub
their
toes
and
helps
that
Castrima
stable
the
Equatorials
once
were
But
that
ferals
teaching
ferals
cAnd
fail
whatever
you
keep
insisting
that
cNone
them
are
worth
rust
You
sess
that
yourself
you
bothered
pay
any
attention
them
not
just
about
skill
also
natural
talent
that
the
whole
reason
the
Fulcrum
made
breed
Essun
And
most
them
will
never
able
get
past
energy
redistribution
This
the
term
that
the
two
you
have
concocted
for
orogeny
done
with
heat
and
kinetics
the
Fulcrum
way
What
Alabaster
now
trying
teach
you
and
what
you
struggling
learn
because
relies
things
that
make
sense
whatsoever
something
you
started
calling
magic
redistribution
That
isn
right
either
not
redistribution
but
until
you
understand
better
Alabaster
still
about
the
orogeny
you
agreed
teach
and
the
children
who
will
fill
cIt
waste
your
time
teach
them
This
dismissal
inexplicably
starts
eat
through
your
patience
cIt
never
waste
time
educate
others
cSpoken
like
simple
creche
teacher
wait
cheap
shot
disrespecting
the
vocation
that
gave
you
years
camouflage
You
should
let
but
feels
like
salt
glass
cut
and
you
snap
cStop
Alabaster
blinks
then
scowls
the
degree
that
can
don
have
great
deal
time
for
coddling
Syen
Essun
Right
now
here
matters
cAnd
don
rusting
care
you
dying
You
don
get
talk
like
this
And
you
get
because
suddenly
you
rusting
done
stares
you
Antimony
there
always
supporting
him
silence
and
her
eyes
shift
you
for
moment
You
think
you
read
surprise
them
but
that
probably
just
projection
cYou
don
care
dying
cNo
don
Why
the
rust
should
You
don
care
any
the
rest
die
You
did
this
Lerna
the
other
end
the
room
glances
and
frowns
and
you
remember
lower
your
voice
cYou
kick
off
sooner
and
more
easily
than
the
rest
get
starve
death
well
after
you
dust
the
ash
And
you
can
bothered
actually
teach
anything
then
fuck
you
figure
out
how
fix
things
myself
you
halfway
across
the
infirmary
your
steps
brisk
and
your
hands
fisted
your
sides
when
snaps
cWalk
out
that
door
and
you
will
starve
death
Stay
and
you
have
chance
You
keep
walking
yelling
over
your
shoulder
You
figured
out
cIt
took
ten
years
And
fucking
flaking
rust
you
hardheaded
steel
hearted
The
geode
jolts
Not
just
the
infirmary
building
but
the
whole
damned
thing
You
hear
cries
alarm
outside
and
that
does
You
stop
and
clench
your
fists
and
slam
counter
torus
against
the
fulcrum
that
positioned
just
underneath
Castrima
doesn
dislodge
his
you
still
not
precise
enough
for
that
and
anyway
you
too
angry
try
very
hard
The
movement
stops
however
whether
because
you
stopped
because
you
surprised
him
much
that
stopped
you
don
care
Then
you
turn
back
storming
him
such
fury
that
Antimony
vanishes
and
suddenly
standing
beside
him
silent
sentinel
warning
You
don
care
about
her
and
you
don
care
that
Alabaster
bent
again
making
low
strained
wheezing
sound
any
cListen
you
selfish
ass
you
snarl
bending
down
the
stone
eater
will
the
only
one
hear
Baster
shaking
visible
pain
and
day
ago
that
would
been
enough
stop
you
Now
you
too
angry
for
pity
have
live
here
even
you
just
waiting
die
and
you
make
these
people
hate
because
you
can
rein
Wait
You
trail
off
distracted
This
time
you
can
see
the
change
happens
his
arm
the
left
one
which
had
been
longer
The
stone
him
creeps
along
slowly
steadily
making
minute
hissing
sound
transmutes
flesh
into
something
else
And
nearly
against
your
will
you
shift
your
sight
has
taught
you
searching
between
the
gelid
bubbles
him
for
those
elusive
tendrils
connection
You
see
suddenly
that
they
are
brighter
almost
like
silver
metal
tightening
into
lattice
and
aligning
new
ways
that
you
never
seen
before
cYou
such
arrogant
ruster
snarls
through
his
teeth
This
breaks
through
your
astonishment
about
his
arm
replacing
with
affront
that
all
people
has
called
you
arrogant
Essun
You
act
like
you
the
only
one
who
made
mistakes
the
only
one
who
ever
died
inside
and
had
keep
going
You
don
know
shit
won
listen
shit
cBecause
you
won
tell
anything
You
expect
listen
you
but
you
don
share
you
just
demand
and
proclaim
and
and
and
not
child
Evil
Earth
wouldn
even
speak
child
this
way
(There
traitor
part
you
that
whispers
Except
you
did
You
spoke
Nassun
like
this
And
the
loyal
part
you
snarls
back
Because
she
wouldn
have
understood
She
wouldn
have
been
safe
you
been
gentler
slower
was
for
her
own
good
and
cIt
for
your
own
rusting
good
Alabaster
grates
The
progression
the
stone
down
his
arm
has
stopped
only
inch
this
time
Lucky
trying
protect
you
for
Earth
sake
You
stop
glaring
him
and
glares
back
and
silence
falls
There
the
clink
something
heavy
and
metallic
being
put
down
behind
you
This
makes
you
glance
back
Lerna
who
looking
you
and
has
folded
his
arms
Most
the
people
Castrima
even
the
orogenes
won
know
what
the
jolt
was
all
about
but
does
because
saw
the
body
language
and
now
you
got
explain
things
him
hopefully
before
doses
Alabaster
next
bowl
mush
with
something
toxic
reminder
that
these
are
not
the
old
days
and
you
cannot
react
the
old
ways
Alabaster
has
not
changed
then
you
Because
you
have
you
straighten
and
take
deep
breath
cYou
never
taught
anyone
anything
have
you
blinks
frowning
apparent
suspicion
your
change
tone
taught
you
cNo
Alabaster
Back
then
you
did
impossible
things
and
just
watched
you
and
tried
not
die
when
imitated
you
But
you
never
tried
intentionally
disseminate
information
another
adult
have
you
You
know
the
answer
even
without
him
saying
but
important
that
say
This
something
needs
learn
muscle
his
jaw
flexes
tried
You
laugh
The
defensive
note
his
voice
tells
you
everything
After
another
moment
consideration
and
deep
breath
marshal
your
self
control
you
sit
down
again
This
leaves
Antimony
looming
over
you
both
but
you
try
ignore
her
cListen
you
say
cYou
need
give
reason
trust
you
His
eyes
narrow
cYou
don
trust
now
cYou
destroyed
the
world
Alabaster
You
told
you
want
make
worse
not
hearing
whole
lot
here
that
screams
Obey
without
question
His
nostrils
flare
The
pain
the
stoning
seems
have
faded
though
drenched
with
sweat
and
still
breathing
hard
But
then
something
his
expression
shifts
too
and
moment
later
slumps
the
degree
that
able
let
him
die
murmurs
looking
away
cOf
course
you
don
trust
cNo
Alabaster
The
Guardians
killed
Innon
half
smiles
cHim
too
Then
you
know
Ten
years
and
like
time
has
passed
all
cNo
you
say
again
But
this
softer
Strengthless
said
wouldn
forgive
you
for
Corundum
but
perhaps
you
not
the
only
one
doesn
forgive
long
silence
passes
cAll
right
says
last
His
voice
very
soft
tell
you
cWhat
cWhere
been
for
the
past
ten
years
glances
Antimony
who
still
looms
over
both
you
cWhat
this
all
about
cShe
isn
ready
the
stone
eater
says
You
jump
her
voice
Alabaster
tries
shrug
winces
something
twinges
somewhere
his
body
sighs
cNeither
was
Antimony
stares
down
both
you
not
really
that
different
from
the
way
she
been
staring
you
since
you
came
back
but
feels
more
pent
Maybe
that
just
projection
But
then
suddenly
she
vanishes
You
see
happen
this
time
Her
form
blurs
becoming
insubstantial
translucent
Then
she
drops
into
the
ground
hole
has
opened
beneath
her
feet
Gone
Alabaster
sighs
cCome
sit
beside
says
You
frown
immediately
cWhy
cSo
can
have
sex
again
Why
the
rust
you
think
You
loved
him
once
You
probably
still
With
sigh
you
get
and
move
the
wall
Gingerly
though
his
back
unburned
you
prop
yourself
for
comfort
then
rest
hand
against
his
back
hold
him
the
way
Antimony
often
does
Alabaster
silent
for
moment
and
then
says
cThank
you
Then
tells
you
everything
