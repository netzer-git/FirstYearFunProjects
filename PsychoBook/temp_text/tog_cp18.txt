Nassun

caps
HAS
BEEN
LONG
since
Nassun
was
proud
herself
that
when
she
becomes
capable
healing
Schaffa
she
runs
all
the
way
through
town
and
Found
Moon
tell
him
cHealing
how
she
thinks
She
has
spent
the
past
few
days
out
the
forest
practicing
her
new
skill
not
always
easy
detect
the
wrongness
body
sometimes
she
must
carefully
follow
the
threads
silver
within
thing
find
its
knots
and
warps
The
ashfalls
have
grown
more
frequent
and
sustained
lately
and
most
the
forest
patchy
with
grayness
some
plants
beginning
wilt
dormant
response
This
normal
for
them
and
the
silver
threads
prove
this
their
uninterrupted
flow
Yet
when
Nassun
goes
slowly
looks
carefully
she
can
usually
find
things
for
which
change
not
normal
healthy
The
grub
beneath
rock
that
has
strange
growth
along
its
side
The
snake
venomous
and
more
vicious
now
that
Season
has
begun
she
only
examines
from
distance
with
broken
vertebra
The
melon
vine
whose
leaves
are
growing
convex
shape
catching
too
much
ash
instead
concavity
which
would
shake
the
ash
off
The
few
ants
nest
who
have
been
infected
parasitic
fungus
She
practices
extraction
the
wrongness
these
things
and
many
others
difficult
trick
master
like
performing
surgery
using
only
thread
without
ever
touching
the
patient
She
learns
how
make
the
edge
one
thread
grow
very
sharp
and
how
loop
and
lasso
with
another
and
how
truncate
third
thread
and
use
the
burning
tip
cauterize
She
gets
the
growth
off
the
grub
but
dies
She
stitches
together
the
edges
broken
bone
within
the
snake
though
this
only
speeds
what
was
already
happening
naturally
She
finds
the
parts
the
plant
that
are
saying
curve
and
convinces
them
say
curve
down
The
ants
are
best
She
cannot
get
all
even
most
the
fungus
out
them
but
she
can
sear
the
connections
their
brains
that
make
them
behave
strangely
and
spread
the
infection
She
very
very
glad
have
brains
work
The
culmination
Nassun
practice
occurs
when
commless
raiders
strike
again
one
morning
dew
still
dampens
the
ash
and
ground
litter
The
band
that
Schaffa
devastated
gone
these
are
new
miscreants
who
don
know
the
danger
Nassun
not
distracted
her
father
anymore
not
helpless
anymore
and
after
she
ices
one
the
raiders
most
the
others
flee
But
she
detects
snarl
threads
one
them
the
last
instant
and
then
must
resort
old
style
orogeny
(as
she
has
come
think
order
drop
the
ground
beneath
the
raider
and
trap
her
pit
The
raider
throws
knife
Nassun
when
she
peeks
over
the
edge
only
luck
that
misses
But
carefully
while
staying
out
sight
Nassun
follows
the
threads
and
finds
three
inch
wooden
splinter
lodged
the
woman
hand
deep
that
scrapes
bone
poisoning
her
blood
and
will
kill
her
already
the
infection
advanced
that
has
swollen
her
hand
twice
its
size
comm
doctor
even
decent
farrier
could
extract
the
thing
but
the
commless
not
have
the
luxury
skilled
care
They
live
luck
what
little
there
Season
Nassun
decides
become
the
woman
luck
She
settles
nearby
that
she
can
concentrate
and
then
carefully
while
the
woman
gasps
and
swears
and
cries
What
happening
she
pulls
the
splinter
free
When
she
looks
into
the
pit
again
the
woman
her
knees
and
groaning
she
holds
her
dripping
hand
Belatedly
Nassun
realizes
she
will
need
learn
how
anesthetize
she
settles
against
the
tree
again
and
casts
her
thread
try
catch
nerve
this
time
takes
her
some
time
learn
how
numb
and
not
just
cause
more
pain
But
she
learns
and
when
she
done
she
feels
grateful
the
raider
woman
who
lies
groaning
and
stupor
the
pit
Nassun
knows
better
than
let
the
woman
she
lives
she
will
only
either
die
slowly
and
cruelly
return
and
perhaps
next
time
threaten
someone
Nassun
loves
Nassun
casts
her
threads
one
last
time
and
this
time
slices
neatly
through
the
top
her
spine
painless
and
kinder
than
the
fate
the
woman
intended
for
Nassun
Now
she
runs
the
hill
toward
Found
Moon
elated
for
the
first
time
since
she
killed
Eitz
eager
see
Schaffa
that
she
barely
notices
the
other
children
the
compound
they
stop
whatever
they
doing
and
favor
her
with
cool
stares
Schaffa
has
explained
them
that
what
she
did
Eitz
was
accident
and
has
assured
her
they
will
eventually
come
around
She
hopes
right
because
she
misses
their
friendship
But
none
that
important
now
cSchaffa
She
first
pokes
her
head
into
the
Guardians
cabin
Only
Nida
there
standing
the
corner
she
often
does
staring
into
the
middle
distance
lost
thought
She
focuses
soon
Nassun
comes
however
and
smiles
her
empty
way
cHello
Schaffa
little
one
she
says
cYou
seem
cheerful
today
cHello
Guardian
She
always
polite
Nida
and
Umber
Just
because
they
want
kill
her
reason
forget
her
manners
cDo
you
know
where
Schaffa
cHe
the
crucible
with
Wudeh
cOkay
thanks
Nassun
hurries
off
undeterred
She
knows
that
Wudeh
the
next
most
skilled
with
Eitz
gone
the
only
other
child
Found
Moon
who
has
some
hope
connecting
obelisk
Nassun
thinks
hopeless
because
one
can
train
him
the
way
needs
trained
given
that
small
and
frail
Wudeh
would
never
have
survived
Mama
crucibles
Still
she
polite
him
too
running
the
edge
the
outermost
practice
circle
and
bouncing
only
little
keeping
her
orogeny
still
not
distract
him
while
raises
big
basalt
column
from
the
ground
and
then
tries
push
back
already
breathing
hard
though
the
column
isn
moving
very
fast
Schaffa
watching
him
intently
his
smile
not
big
usual
Schaffa
sees
too
Finally
Wudeh
gets
the
column
back
into
the
ground
Schaffa
takes
his
shoulder
and
helps
him
over
bench
which
plainly
necessary
because
Wudeh
can
barely
walk
this
point
Schaffa
glances
Nassun
and
Nassun
nods
once
and
turns
run
back
into
the
mess
hall
fetch
glass
from
the
pitcher
fruit
water
there
When
she
brings
Wudeh
blinks
her
once
then
looks
ashamed
hesitating
and
finally
takes
with
shy
nod
thanks
Schaffa
always
right
cDo
you
need
help
back
the
dormitory
Schaffa
asks
him
can
make
back
myself
sir
Wudeh
says
His
eyes
dart
Nassun
which
Nassun
understands
that
Wudeh
probably
would
like
help
back
but
knows
better
than
get
between
Schaffa
and
his
favorite
student
Nassun
looks
Schaffa
She
excited
but
she
can
wait
lifts
eyebrow
then
inclines
his
head
and
extends
hand
help
Wudeh
Once
Wudeh
safely
abed
Schaffa
comes
back
over
where
Nassun
now
sits
the
bench
She
calmer
for
the
delay
which
good
because
she
knows
she
going
need
seem
calm
and
cool
and
professional
order
convince
him
let
some
half
grown
half
trained
girl
experiment
him
with
magic
Schaffa
sits
down
beside
her
looking
amused
cAll
right
then
She
takes
deep
breath
before
beginning
know
how
take
the
thing
out
you
They
both
know
exactly
what
she
talking
about
She
has
sat
beside
Schaffa
quietly
offering
herself
has
huddled
this
very
bench
clutching
his
head
and
whispering
replies
voice
she
cannot
hear
and
shuddering
punishes
him
with
lashes
silver
pain
Even
now
low
angry
throb
inside
him
pushing
him
obey
kill
her
She
makes
herself
available
because
her
presence
eases
the
pain
for
him
and
because
she
does
not
believe
will
actually
kill
her
This
folly
she
knows
Love
inoculation
against
murder
But
she
needs
believe
him
Schaffa
frowns
her
and
part
why
she
loves
him
that
shows
sign
disbelief

have
sensed

This
happened
the
orogenes
the
Fulcrum
too
when
they
were
allowed
progress

point
They
become

own
teachers
The
power

them
along

His
brow
furrows
slightly
cGenerally
steered
them
away
from
this
path
though
cWhy
cBecause
dangerous
everyone
not
just
the
orogene
question
leans
against
her
shoulder
warm
and
supportive
cYou
survived
the
point
that
kills
most:
connecting
with
obelisk
remember
how
others
died
making
the
attempt
For
moment
looks
troubled
lost
confused
probes
gingerly
the
raw
edges
his
torn
memories
remember
something
glad
winces
again
looks
troubled
again
This
time
isn
the
silver
that
hurting
him
Nassun
guesses
either
remembered
something
dislikes
can
remember
something
thinks
should
She
won
able
take
the
pain
loss
away
from
him
matter
how
good
she
gets
sobering
She
can
remove
the
rest
his
pain
though
and
that
the
part
that
matters
She
touches
his
hand
her
fingers
covering
the
thin
scars
that
she
has
seen
him
inflict
with
his
own
nails
when
the
pain
grows
too
great
even
for
his
smiles
ease
There
are
more
them
today
than
there
were
few
days
ago
some
still
raw
didn
die
she
reminds
him
blinks
and
this
alone
enough
snap
him
back
into
the
here
and
now
himself
cNo
You
didn
But
Nassun
adjusts
their
hands
now
holding
hers
His
hand
huge
and
she
can
even
see
glimpse
her
own
within
She
has
always
liked
this
being
enveloped
completely
him
cMy
compassionate
one
not
want
corestone
removed
Corestone
Now
she
knows
the
name
her
nemesis
The
word
makes
sense
because
metal
not
stone
and
not
the
core
him
just
his
head
but
that
doesn
matter
She
clenches
her
jaw
against
hate
cIt
hurts
you
cAs
should
have
betrayed
His
jaw
tightens
briefly
cBut
accepted
the
consequences
doing
Nassun
can
bear
them
This
makes
sense
cIt
hurts
you
could
stop
the
hurt
can
even
make
stop
hurting
without
taking
out
but
only
for
little
while
have
stay
with
you
She
learned
this
from
that
conversation
with
Steel
and
watching
what
the
stone
eater
did
Stone
eaters
are
full
magic
much
more
than
people
but
Nassun
can
approximate
cBut
take
out
cIf
you
take
out
Schaffa
says
will
longer
Guardian
you
know
what
that
means
Nassun
means
that
then
Schaffa
can
her
father
every
way
that
matters
already
Nassun
does
not
think
this
many
words
because
there
are
things
she
not
yet
prepared
confront
about
herself
her
life
(This
will
change
very
soon
But
her
mind
cIt
means
that
will
lose
much
strength
and
health
says
reply
her
silent
wishing

little
one
His
eyes
flick
toward
the
Guardians
cabin
and
she
understands
then
Umber
and
Nida
will
kill
her
They
will
try
she
thinks
His
head
tilts
course
instantly
aware
her
defiant
intent
cYou
couldn
defeat
them
both
Nassun
Even
you
aren
that
powerful
They
have
tricks
you
haven
yet
seen
Skills
that

troubled
again

what

doing

Nassun
tries
not
let
her
bottom
lip
poke
out
Her
mother
always
said
that
was
pouting
and
that
pouting
and
whining
were
things
only
babies
did
cYou
shouldn
say
because
She
could
take
care
herself
not
mention
that
only
hopes
that
the
urge
for
self
preservation
will
help
convince
you
But
for
own
part
not
want
grow
weak
and
ill
and
die
Nassun
which
what
would
happen
you
took
the
stone
older
than
you
realize
The
blurry
look
returns
for
moment
this
she
knows
does
not
remember
how
old
cOlder
than

Without

the

And
then
die
cYou

And

Schaffa

the
memory
Then
focuses
her
cMy

Have

Nassun
bursts
into
tears
She
not
really
sure
why
except
except
maybe
because
she
been
wanting
this
working
toward
much
She
wanted
something
good
with
orogeny
when
she
has
used
many
terrible
things
already
and
she
wanted
for
him
the
only
person
the
world
who
understands
her
loves
her
for
what
she
protects
her
despite
what
she
Schaffa
sighs
and
pulls
Nassun
into
his
lap
where
she
wraps
herself
around
him
and
blubbers
into
his
shoulder
for
long
while
heedless
the
fact
that
they
are
out
the
open
When
the
weeping
has
spent
itself
though
she
realizes
that
holding
her
just
tightly
The
silver
alive

crouch
over
him
and
grin
into
his
face
while
Jija
stared
back
with
wide
frightened
eyes
She
can

For

anything

layered
over
the

Nassun
climbs
out
his

She
tired
even

she
hasn

Emotion
always
makes
her
tired
But
she
heads
down
the

into
Jekity
nodding
people
she
knows
whether
they
nod
back
not
noticing
the
new
granary
the
village
building
since
they
had

increase
their

Schaffa
Nassun
would
hate
here
the
same
way
She
may
never
understand
why
Mama
had
the
whole
the
world
open
her
after
somehow
escaping
her
Fulcrum
she
chose
live
such
placid
backwater
place
Thus
with
her
mother
her
mind
that
Nassun
knocks
the
door
her
father
house
(She
has
room
here

isn
her
house
This
why
she
knocks
Jija
opens
the
door
almost
immediately
was
about
leave
and
somewhere
has
been
waiting
for
her
The
scent
something
redolent
with
garlic
wafts
out
the
house
from
the
little
hearth
near
the
back
Nassun
thinks
maybe
fish
pot
since
the
Jekity
comm
shares
have
lot
fish
and
vegetables
them
the
first

Jija
has
seen
her
month
and
his
eyes
widen
for
moment
cHi

she
says
awkward
Jija
bends
and
before
Nassun
quite
knows
what
happening
picked
her
and
swept
her
into
embrace
Jekity
feels
like
Tirimo
but
good
way
now
Like
back
when
Mama
was
around
but
Daddy
was
the
one
who
loved
her
most
and
the
stuff
the
stove
would
duck
pot
instead
fish
this
were
then
Mama
would
yelling
the
neighbors

for
stealing
cabbages
from
their
housegreen
Old
Lady
Tukke
never
did
tie
the
creature
the
way
she
should
The
air
would
smell
like
does
now
rich
cooking
food
mingled
with
the
more
acrid
scents
freshly
chipped
rock
and
the
chemicals
Daddy
uses
soften
and
smooth
his
knappings
Uche
would
running
around
the
background
making
whoosh
sounds
and
yelling
that
was
falling
tried
jump
the
air
Nassun
stiffens
Jija
embrace
she
suddenly
realizes:
Uche
Jumping
Falling
pretending
Uche
whom
Daddy
beat
death
Jija
feels
her
tense
and
tenses
well
Slowly
lets
her
easing
her
the
ground
the
joy
his
expression
fades
unease
cNassun
says
His
gaze
searches
her
face
cAre
you
all
right
okay
Daddy
She
misses
his
arms
around
her
She
can
help
that
But
the
epiphany
about
Uche
has
reminded
her
careful
just
wanted
see
you
Some
the
unease
Jija
fades
little
hesitates
seems
fumble
for
something
say
then
finally
stands
aside
cCome
Are
you
hungry
There
enough
for
you
too
she
heads
inside
and
they
sit
down
eat
and
fusses
over
how
long
her
hair
has
gotten
and
how
nice
the
cornrows
and
puffs
look
Did
she
them
herself
And
she
little
taller
She
might
she
acknowledges
with
blush
even
though
she
knows
for
certain
that
she
whole
inch
taller
than
the
last

Jija
measured

She
such
big
girl
now
Jija
says
and
there
such
real
pride
his
voice
that
disarms
her
defenses
Almost
eleven
and
beautiful
strong
much
like

Nassun
looks
down
her
plate
because
almost
said

this
not
how

Daddy
Nassun
makes
herself
say
terrible

that

and
strong
like
her
mother
but
love
always
comes
bound
terrible
things

Because
she
does

everything
Jija
stiffens
slightly
and
muscle
along
the
curve
his
jaw
flexes

This
obviously
lie
that
Nassun
stares
and
forgets
pretend
agree
with
him
Forgets
lots
things
apparently
including
common
sense
because
she
blurts
cBut
you
You
miss
Uche
too
can
tell
Jija
goes
rigid
and
stares
her
something
that
falls
between
shock
that
she
would
say
this
out
loud
and
horror
what
she
has
said
And
then
Nassun
has
come
understand
normal
for
her
father
the
shock
the
unexpected
abruptly
transforms
into
anger
cIs

around

says
She

even
inflectionless
but
she
can
hear
the
frustration
there
She
can

But

she

that

But

She
knows
better
than

But

opens
his
mouth
retort
then
seems
catch
himself
looks
away
propping
his
elbows

table
and
steepling
his
hands
the
way
often
does
when
trying

says
and

She
hates

exasperated
the
fact
that
apparently
never

That
she
doing
now
and
doesn
see
Why
even
love
him
anymore
Nassun
finds
herself
thinking
she
stares
her
father
Instead
she
says:
cWhy
you
hate
much
Daddy
Jija
flinches
perhaps
her
casual
don

you
cYou

Jija
pushes
back
from
the

and
stands
Nassun
flinches
despite
herself
but
turns
away
and
starts
pace

half

around

standing
over

his

and

heaving
his

clenched
around
the

Then
Nassun
gets
found
him
behind
the
spadeseed
silo
one
day
was
squatting
there
shaking
thought
was
sick
Jija
shaking
his
head
the
whole
time
still
pacing
cThere
was

Litisk
and
Litisk
just
Jija
stops
abruptly
baring
his

His
shoulders
are
heaving
the

way
they
were
that
day
cKirl

screaming

Litisk
was

The

even

just
kept
freezing
Kirl
wouldn
stop
the
time
ran
away
Kirl
was
reaching
for
and
the
only
thing
left
him
that
wasn
frozen
was
his
head
and
his

even

not

Nassun
know
that
there
reason
specific
reason
for
what
her
father
has
done
All
she
can
think
Uche
never
lost
control
like
that
Mama
wouldn
have
let
him
true
Mama
had
been
able

and
still
Nassun
orogeny
from
all
the
way
across
town
sometimes
Which
means
Uche
didn
anything
provoke
Jija
Jija
killed
his
own
son
for
what
completely
different
person
did
long
before
that
son
birth
This
more
than
anything
helps
her
finally
understand
that

Nassun
almost
prepared
when
Jija
gaze
suddenly
shifts
her
sidelong
and
suspicious
cWhy
haven
you
cured
yourself
yet
reasoning
But
she
tries
because
once
upon
time
this
man
was
her
whole
world
might
able
soon
learned
how
make
things
happen
with
the
silver
and
how
take
things
out
people
don
know
how
orogeny
works
where
comes
from
but
something
that
can
taken
out
then
cNone
the
other
monsters
that
camp
have
cured
themselves
asked
around
Jija
pacing
has
gotten
noticeably
faster
cThey
there
and
they
don

better
They
live
there
with

cIt

She
understands
this
instinctively
With
enough
fine
control
and
the

obelisk
aid
she
will
able
almost
anything
cBut
cWhy

Because
this

she
wants

she
realizes

does
not

She
doesn

because
there
point
She
cannot

what
wants

fair
that
calls

lying
himself
now
But
the
lies
telling
her
has
been
Nassun
understands
suddenly
her
whole
life
that
really
break
her
heart
said
that
loved
her
after
all
but
that
obviously
isn
true
cannot
love
orogene
and
that
what
she
cannot
orogene
father
and
that
why
constantly
demands
she
something
other
than
what
she
And
she
tired
Tired
and
done
like
being
orogene
Daddy
she
says
His
eyes
widen
This
terrible
thing
that
she
saying
terrible
thing
that
she
loves
herself
like
making
things
move
and
doing
the
silver
and
falling
into
the
obelisks
don
like
She
about
say
that
she
hates
what
she
did
Eitz
and
she
especially
hates
the
way
that
others
treat
her
now
that
they
know
what
she
capable
but
she
doesn
get
the
chance
Jija
takes
two
swift
steps
forward
and
the
back
his
hand
swings
fast
that
she
doesn
even
see
before
has
knocked
her
out
the
chair
like
that
day
the
Imperial
Road
when
she
suddenly
found
herself
the
bottom
hill
pain
must
have
been
like
this
for
Uche
she
realizes
another
swift
epiphany
The
world
should
one
moment
and
completely
wrong
completely
broken
instant
later
least
Uche
didn
have
time
hate
she
thinks
sorrow
And
then
she
ices
the
entire
house
isn
reflex
She
intentional
about
precise
shaping
the
torus
fit
the
dimensions
the
house
exactly
one
past
the
walls
will
caught
She
shapes
twin
cores
out
the
torus
too
and
centers
each
herself
and
her
father
She
feels
cold
along
the
hairs
her
skin
the
tug
lowered
air
pressure
her
clothing
and
plaited
hair
Jija
feels
the
same
thing
and
screams
his
eyes
wide
and
wild
and
sightless
The
memory
boy
cruel
icy
death
his
face
the
time
Nassun
gets
her
feet
staring
her
father
across
floor
slick
with
plates
solid
ice
and
around
the
fallen
over
chair
that
now
too
warped
ever
use
again
Jija
has
stumbled
back
slipped
the
ice
fallen
and
slid
partially
across
the
floor
bump
against
the
table
legs
There
danger
Nassun
only
manifested
the
torus
for
instant
warning
against
further
violence
his
part
Jija
keeps
screaming
though
Nassun
gazes
down
her
huddled
panicking
father
Perhaps
she
should
feel
pity
regret
What
she
actually
feels
however
cold
fury
toward
her
mother
She
knows
irrational
one
fault
except
Jija
that
Jija
too
afraid
orogenes
love
his
own
children
Once
however
Nassun
could
love
her
father
without
qualification
Now
she
needs
someone
blame
for
the
loss
that
perfect
love
She
knows
her
mother
can
bear
You
should
have
had
with
someone
stronger
she
thinks
Essun
wherever
she
takes
care
walk
across
the
slick
floor
without
slipping
and
Nassun
has
jiggle
the
latch
for
few
seconds
scrape
open
the
time
she
does
Jija
has
stopped
screaming
behind
her
though
she
can
still
hear
him
breathing
hard
and
uttering
little
moan
with
every
exhalation
She
doesn
want
look
back
him
She
makes
herself
anyway
though
because
she
wants
good
orogene
and
good
orogenes
cannot
afford
self
deception
Jija
jerks
her
gaze
has
the
power
burn
