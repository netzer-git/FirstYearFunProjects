The
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
TARAN
WANTED
make
sword
but
Coll
charged
with
the
practical
side
his
education
decided
horseshoes
And
had
been
horseshoes
all
morning
long
Taran
arms
ached
soot
blackened
his
face
last
dropped
the
hammer
and
turned
Coll
who
was
watching
him
critically
Why
Taran
cried
Why
must
horseshoes
had
any
horses
Coll
was
stout
and
round
and
his
great
bald
head
glowed
bright
pink
Lucky
for
the
horses
was
all
said
glancing
Taran
handiwork
could
better
making
sword
Taran
protested
know
could
And
before
Coll
could
answer
snatched
the
tongs
flung
strip
red
hot
iron
the
anvil
and
began
hammering
away
fast
could
Wait

cried
Coll
that
not
the
way
after
Heedless
Coll
unable
even
hear
him
above
the
din
Taran
pounded
harder
than
ever
Sparks
sprayed
the
air
But
the
more
pounded
the
more
the
metal
twisted
and
buckled
until
finally
the
iron
sprang
from
the
tongs
and
fell
the
ground
Taran
stared
dismay
With
the
tongs
picked
the
bent
iron
and
examined
Not
quite
the
blade
for
hero
Coll
remarked
ruined
Taran
glumly
agreed
looks
like
sick
snake
added
ruefully
tried
telling
you
said
Coll
you
had
all
wrong
You
must
hold
the
tongs
When
you
strike
the
strength
must
flow
from
your
shoulder
and
your
wrist
loose
You
can
hear
when
you
right
There
kind
music
Besides
added
this
not
the
metal
for
weapons
Coll
returned
the
crooked
half
formed
blade

furnace
where
lost
its
shape
entirely
wish
might
have
own
sword
Taran
sighed
and
you
would
teach
sword
fighting
Wisht
cried
Coll
Why
should
you
want
know
that
have
battles
Caer
Dallben
have
horses
either
objected
Taran
but
making
horseshoes
Get
with
you
said
Coll
unmoved
That
for
practice
And
would
this
Taran
urged
Come
teach
the
sword
fighting
You
must
know
the
art
Coll
shining
head
glowed

appeared
his
face
though
were
savoring
something
pleasant
True
said
quietly

held
sword
once
twice

Teach
now
pleaded
Taran
seized
poker
and
brandished
slashing
the
air
and
dancing
back
and
forth
over
the
hard
packed
earthen
floor
See
called

most
already
Hold
your
hand
chuckled
Coll
you
were
come
against
like
that
with
all
your
posing
and
bouncing
should
have
you
chopped
into
bits

time

Look

picked
another
poker
Here
now
ordered
with
sooty
wink
stand
like
man
Taran
brought
his
poker
While
Coll
shouted
instructions
they
set
parrying
and
thrusting
with
much
banging
clanking
and
commotion
For
moment
Taran
was
sure
had
the
better
Coll
but
the
old
man
spun
away
with
amazing
lightness
foot
Now
was
Taran
who
strove
desperately
ward
off
Coll
blows
Abruptly
Coll
stopped
did
Taran
his
poker
poised
mid
air
the
doorway
the
forge
stood
the
tall
bent
figure
Dallben
Dallben
master
Caer
Dallben
was
three
hundred
and
seventy
nine
years
old
His
beard
covered
much
his
face
seemed
always
peering
over
gray
cloud
the
little
farm
while
Taran
and
Coll
saw
the
plowing
sowing
weeding
reaping
and
all
the
other
tasks
husbandry
Dallben
undertook
the
meditating
occupation
exhausting
could
accomplish
only
lying
down
and
closing
his
eyes
meditated
hour
and
half
following
breakfast
and
again
later
the
day
The
clatter
from
the
forge
had
roused
him
from
his
morning
meditation
his
robe
hung
askew
over
his
boney
knees
Stop
that
nonsense
directly
said
Dallben
surprised
you
added
frowning
Coll
There
serious
work
done
wasn
Coll
Taran
interrupted
was
who
asked
learn
sword
play
did
not
say
was
surprised
you
remarked
Dallben
But
perhaps
after
all
think
you
had
best
come
with
Taran
followed
the
ancient
man
out
the
forge
across
the
chicken
run
and
into
the
white
thatched
cottage
There
Dallben
chamber
moldering
tomes
overflowed
the
sagging
shelves
and
spilled
onto
the
floor
amid
heaps
iron
cook
pots
studded
belts
harps
with
without
strings
and
other
oddments
Taran
took
his
place
the
wooden
bench
always
did
when
Dallben
was
mood
for
giving
lessons
reprimands
fully
understand
said
Dallben
settling
himself
behind
his
table
the
use
weapons
everything
else
there
certain
skill
But
wiser
heads
than
yours
will
determine
when
you
should
learn
sorry
Taran
began
should
not
have
not
angry
Dallben
said
raising
hand
Only
little
sad
Time
flies
quickly
things
always
happen
sooner
than
one
expects
And
yet
murmured
almost
himself
troubles
fear
the
Horned
King
may
have
some
part
this
The
Horned
King
asked
Taran
shall
speak
him
later
said
Dallben
drew
ponderous
leather
bound
volume
toward
him
The
Book
Three
from
which
occasionally
read
Taran
and
which
the
boy
believed
held
its
pages
everything
anyone
could
possibly
want
know
have
explained
you
before
Dallben
went
and
you
have
very
likely
forgotten
Prydain
land
many
cantrevs
small
kingdoms
and
many
kings
And
course
their
war
leaders
who
command
the
warriors
But
there
the
High
King
above
them
all
said
Taran
Math
Son
Mathonwy
His
war
leader
the
mightiest
hero
Prydain
You
told
him
Prince
Gwydion
Yes
Taran
went
eagerly
know
There
are
other
things
you
not
know
Dallben
said
for
the
obvious
reason
that
have
not
told
you
For
the
moment
less
concerned
with
the
realms
the
living
than
with
the
Land
the
Dead
with
Annuvin
Taran
shuddered
the
word
Even
Dallben
had
spoken
whisper
And
with
King
Arawn
Lord
Annuvin
Dallben
said
Know
this
continued
quickly
Annuvin
more
than
land
death
treasure
house
not
only
gold
and
jewels
but
all
things
advantage
men
Long
ago
the
race
men
owned
these
treasures
craft
and
deceit
Arawn
stole
them
one
one
for
his
own
evil
uses
Some
few
the
treasures
have
been
wrested
from
him
though
most
lie
hidden
deep
Annuvin
where
Arawn
guards
them
jealously
But
Arawn
did
not
become
ruler
Prydain
Taran
said
You
may
thankful
did
not
said
Dallben
would
have
ruled
had
not
been
for
the
Children
Don
the
sons
the
Lady
Don
and
her
consort
Belin
King
the
Sun
Long
ago
they
voyaged
Prydain
from
the
Summer
Country
and
found
the
land
rich
and
fair
though
the
race
men
had
little
for
themselves
The
Sons
Don
built
their
stronghold
Caer
Dathyl
far
north
the
Eagle
Mountains
From
there
they
helped
regain
least
portion
what
Arawn
had
stolen
and
stood
guardians
against
the
lurking
threat
Annuvin
hate
think
what
would
have
happened
the
Sons
Don
hadn
come
Taran
said
was
good
destiny
that
brought
them
not
always
sure
said
Dallben
with
wry
smile
The
men
Prydain
came
rely
the
strength
the
House
Don
child
clings
its
mother
They
even
today
Math
the
High
King
descended
from
the
House
Don
Prince
Gwydion
But
that
all
the
way
Prydain
has
been
peace
much
men
can
peaceful
until
now
What
you
not
know
Dallben
said
this:
has
reached
ears
that
new
and
mighty
warlord
has
risen
powerful
Gwydion
some
say
more
powerful
But
man
evil
for
whom
death
black
joy
sports
with
death
you
might
sport
with
dog
Who
cried
Taran
Dallben
shook
his
head
man
knows
his
name
nor
has
any
man
seen
his
face
wears
antlered
mask
and
for
this
reason
called
the
Horned
King
His
purposes
not
know
suspect
the
hand
Arawn
but
what
manner
cannot
tell
tell
you
now
for
your
own
protection
Dallben
added
From
what
saw
this
morning
your
head
full
nonsense
about
feats
arms
Whatever
notions
you
may
have
advise
you
forget
them
immediately
There
unknown
danger
abroad
You
are
barely
the
threshold
manhood
and
have
certain
responsibility
see
that
you
reach
preferably
with
whole
skin
you
are
not
leave
Caer
Dallben
under
any
circumstances
not
even
past
the
orchard
and
certainly
not
into
the
forest
not
for
the
time
being
For
the
time
being
Taran
burst
out
think
will
always
for
the
time
being
and
will
vegetables
and
horseshoes
all
life
Tut
said
Dallben
there
are
worse
things
you
set
yourself
glorious
hero
you
believe
all
flashing
swords
and
galloping
about
horses
for
being
glorious
What
Prince
Gwydion
cried
Taran
Yes
wish
might
like
him
fear
Dallben
said
that
entirely
out
the
question
But
why
Taran
sprang
his
feet
know
had
the
chance
Why
Dallben
interrupted
some
cases
said
learn
more
looking
for
the
answer
question
and
not
finding
than
from
learning
the
answer
itself
This
one
those
cases
could
tell
you
why
but
the
moment
would
only
more
confusing
you
grow
with
any
kind
sense
which
you
sometimes
make
doubt
you
will
very
likely
reach
your
own
conclusions
They
will
probably
wrong
added
However
since
they
will
yours
you
will
feel
little
more
satisfied
with
them
Taran
sank
back
and
sat
gloomy
and
silent
the
bench
Dallben
had
already
begun
meditating
again
His
chin
gradually
came
rest
his
collarbone
his
beard
floated
around
his
ears
like
fog
bank
and
began
snoring
peacefully
The
spring
scent
apple
blossom
drifted
through
the
open
window
Beyond
Dallben
chamber
Taran
glimpsed
the
pale
green
fringe
forest
The
fields
ready
cultivate
would
soon
turn
golden
with
summer
The
Book
Three
lay
closed
the
table
Taran
had
never
been
allowed
read
the
volume
for
himself
now
was
sure
held
more
than
Dallben
chose
tell
him
the
sun
filled
room
with
Dallben
still
meditating
and
showing
sign
stopping
Taran
rose
and
moved
through
the
shimmering
beams
From
the
forest
came
the
monotonous
tick
beetle
His
hands
reached
for
the
cover
Taran
gasped
pain
and
snatched
them
away
They
smarted
each
his
fingers
had
been
stung
hornets
jumped
back
stumbled
against
the
bench
and
dropped
the
floor
where
put
his
fingers
woefully
into
his
mouth
Dallben
eyes
blinked
open
peered
Taran
and
yawned
slowly
You
had
better
see
Coll
about
lotion
for
those
hands
advised
Otherwise
shouldn
surprised
they
blistered
Fingers
smarting
the
shamefaced
Taran
hurried
from
the
cottage
and
found
Coll
near
the
vegetable
garden
You
have
been
The
Book
Three
Coll
said
That
not
hard
guess
Now
you
know
better
Well
that
one
the
three
foundations
learning:
see
much
study
much
suffer
much
led
Taran
the
stable
where
medicines
for
the
livestock
were
kept
and
poured
concoction
over
Taran
fingers
What
the
use
studying
much
when
see
nothing
all
Taran
retorted
think
there
destiny
laid
that
not
know
anything
interesting
anywhere
interesting
anything
interesting
certainly
not
anything
not
anything
even
Caer
Dallben
Very
well
said
Coll
that
all
that
troubles
you
shall
make
you
something
From
this
moment
you
are
Taran
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
You
shall
help
take
care
Hen
Wen:
see
her
trough
full
carry
her
water
and
give
her
good
scrubbing
every
other
day
That
what
now
Taran
said
bitterly
All
the
better
said
Coll
for
makes
things
that
much
easier
you
want
something
with
name
attached
can
think
anything
closer
hand
And
not
every
lad
who
can
assistant
keeper
oracular
pig
Indeed
she
the
only
oracular
pig
Prydain
and
the
most
valuable
Valuable
Dallben
Taran
said
She
never
tells
anything
Did
you
think
she
would
replied
Coll
With
Hen
Wen
you
must
know
how
ask
here
what
was
that
Coll
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
black
buzzing
cloud
streaked
from
the
orchard
and
bore
rapidly
and
passed
close
Coll
head
that
had
leap
out
the
way
The
bees
Taran
shouted
They
swarming
not
their
time
cried
Coll
There
something
amiss
The
cloud
rose
high
toward
the
sun
instant
later
Taran
heard
loud
clucking
and
squawking
from
the
chicken
run
turned
see
the
five
hens
and
the
rooster
beating
their
wings
Before
occurred
him
they
were
attempting
fly
they
too
were
aloft
Taran
and
Coll
raced
the
chicken
run
too
late
catch
the
fowls
With
the
rooster
leading
the
chickens
flapped
awkwardly
through
the
air
and
disappeared
over
the
brow
hill
From
the
stable
the
pair
oxen
bellowed
and
rolled
their
eyes
terror
Dallben
head
poked
out
the
window
looked
irritated
has
become
absolutely
impossible
for
any
kind
meditation
whatsoever
said
with
severe
glance
Taran
have
warned
you
once
Something
frightened
the
animals
Taran
protested
First
the
bees
then
the
chickens
flew
off
Dallben
face
turned
grave
have
been
given
knowledge
this
said
Coll
must
ask
Hen
Wen
about
immediately
and
shall
need
the
letter
sticks
Quickly
help
find
them
Coll
moved
hastily
the
cottage
door
Watch
Hen
Wen
closely
ordered
Taran
not
let
her
out
your
sight
Coll
disappeared
inside
the
cottage
search
for
Hen
Wen

the
long
rods
ash

carved
with
spells
Taran
was
both
frightened
and
excited
Dallben
knew
would
consult
Hen
Wen
only
matter
greatest
urgency
Within
Taran
memory
had
never
happened
before
hurried
the
pen
Hen
Wen
usually
slept
until
noon
Then
trotting
daintily
despite
her
size
she
would
move
shady
comer
her
enclosure
and
settle
comfortably
for
the
rest
the
day
The
white
pig
was
continually
grunting
and
chuckling
herself
and
whenever
she
saw
Taran
she
would
raise
her
wide
cheeky
face
that
could
scratch
under
her
chin
But
this
time
she
paid
attention
him
Wheezing
and
whistling
Hen
Wen
was
digging
furiously
the
soft
earth
the
far
side
the
pen
burrowing
rapidly
she
would
soon
out
Taran
shouted
her
but
the
clods
continued
flying
great
rate
swung
himself
over
the
fence
The
oracular
pig
stopped
and
glanced
around
Taran
approached
the
hole
already
sizable
Hen
Wen
hurried
the
opposite
side
the
pen
and
started
new
excavation
Taran
was
strong
and
long
legged
but
his
dismay
saw
that
Hen
Wen
moved
faster
than
soon
chased
her
from
the
second
hole
she
turned
quickly
her
short
legs
and
made
for
the
first
Both
now
were
big
enough
for
her
head
and
shoulders
Taran
frantically
began
scraping
earth
back
into
the
burrow
Hen
Wen
dug
faster
than
badger
her
hind
legs
planted
firmly
her
front
legs
plowing
ahead
Taran
despaired
stopping
her
scrambled
back
over
the
rails
and
jumped
the
spot
where
Hen
Wen
was
about
emerge
planning
seize
her
and
hang
until
Dallben
and
Coll
arrived

the

burst
from
under
the

Taran
into
the

with
the
wind
knocked
out
him
Hen
Wen
raced
across
the
field
and
into
the
woods
Taran
followed
Ahead
the
forest
rose
dark
and
threatening
took
breath
and
plunged
after

The

Ahead
Taran
heard
thrashing
among
the
leaves
The
pig
was
sure
was
keeping
out

the
bushes
Following
the
sound
ran
forward
After
time

rose
sharply

Taran
caught

Hen

dashing
into
the
waving

Once
across
the

she
disappeared

Taran
hurried
after
her
This
was
farther
than
had
ever
dared
venture
but
struggled
through
the
heavy
undergrowth
Soon
fairly
wide
trail
opened
allowing
him
quicken
his
pace
Hen
Wen
had
either
stopped
running
had
outdistanced
him
heard
nothing
but
his
own
footsteps
followed
the
trail
for
some
while
intending
use
landmark
the
way
back
although
twisted
and
branched
off
frequently
was
not
all
certain
which
direction
Caer
Dallben
lay
the
meadow
Taran
had
been
flushed
and
perspiring
Now
shivered
the
silence
oaks
and
elms
The
woods
here
were
not
thick
but
shadows
drenched
the
high
tree
trunks
and
the
sun
broke
through
only
jagged
streaks
damp
green
scent
filled
the
air
bird
called
squirrel
chattered
The
forest
seemed
holding
its
breath
Yet
there
was
beneath
the
silence
groaning
restlessness
and
trembling
among
the
leaves
The
branches
twisted
and
grated
against
each
other
like
broken
teeth
The
path
wavered
under
Taran
feet
and
felt
desperately
cold
flung
his
arms
around
himself
and
moved
more
quickly
shake
off
the
chill
was
realized
running
aimlessly
could
not
keep
his
mind
the
forks
and
turns
the
path
halted
suddenly
Hoofbeats
thudded
front
him
The
forest
shook
they
grew
louder
another
moment
black
horse
burst
into
view
Taran
fell
back
terrified
Astride
the
foam
spattered
animal
rode
monstrous
figure
crimson
cloak
flamed
from
his
naked
shoulders
Crimson
stained
his
gigantic
arms
Horror
stricken
Taran
saw
not
the
head
man
but
the
antlered
head
stag
The
Horned
King
Taran
flung
himself
against
oak
escape
the
flying
hoofs
and
the
heaving
glistening
flanks
Horse
and
rider
swept
The
mask
was
human
skull
from
the
great
antlers
rose
cruel
curves
The
Horned
King
eyes
blazed
behind
the
gaping
sockets
whitened
bone
Many
horsemen
galloped
his
train
The
Horned
King
uttered
the
long
cry
wild
beast
and
his
riders
took
they
streamed
after
him
One
them
ugly
grinning
warrior
caught
sight
Taran
turned
his
mount
and
drew
sword
Taran
sprang
from
the
tree
and
plunged
into
the
underbrush
The
blade
followed
hissing
like
adder
Taran
felt
sting
across
his
back
ran
blindly
while
saplings
whipped
his
face
and
hidden
rocks
jutted
out
pitch
him
forward
and
stab
his
knees
Where
the
woods
thinned
Taran
clattered
along
dry
stream
bed
until
exhausted
stumbled
and
held
out
his
hands
against
the
whirling
ground
THE
SUN
HAD
already
dipped
westward
when
Taran
opened
his
eyes
was
lying
stretch
turf
with
cloak
thrown
over
him
One
shoulder
smarted
painfully
man
knelt
beside
him
Nearby
white
horse
cropped
the
grass
Still
dazed
fearful
the
riders
had
overtaken
him
Taran
started
The
man
held
out
flask
Drink
said
Your
strength
will
return
moment
The
stranger
had
the
shaggy
gray
streaked
hair
wolf
His
eyes
were
deep
set
flecked
with
green
Sun
and
wind
had
leathered
his
broad
face
burnt
dark
and
grained
with
fine
lines
His
cloak
was
coarse
and
travel
stained
wide
belt
with
intricately
wrought
buckle
circled
his
waist
Drink
the
stranger
said
again
while
Taran
took
the
flask
dubiously
You
look
though
were
trying
poison
you
smiled
not
thus
that
Gwydion
Son
Don
deals
with

Gwydion
Taran
choked
the
liquid
and
stumbled
his
feet
You
are
not
Gwydion
cried
know
him
great
war
leader
hero
not
His
eyes
fell
the
long
sword
the
stranger
belt
The
golden
pommel
was
smooth
and
rounded
its
color
deliberately
muted
ash
leaves
pale
gold
entwined
the
hilt
and
pattern
leaves
covered
the
scabbard
was
truly
the
weapon
prince
Taran
dropped
one
knee
and
bowed
his
head
Lord
Gwydion
said
did
not
intend
insolence
Gwydion
helped
him
rise
Taran
still
stared
disbelief
the
simple
attire
and
the
worn
lined
face
From
all
Dallben
had
told
him
this
glorious
hero
from
all
had
pictured
himself
Taran
bit
his
lips
Gwydion
caught
Taran
look
disappointment
not
the
trappings
that
make
the
prince
said
gently
nor
indeed
the
sword
that
makes
the
warrior
Come
ordered
tell
your
name
and
what
happened
you
And
not
ask
believe
you
got
sword
wound
picking
gooseberries
poaching
hares
saw
the
Horned
King
Taran
burst
out
His
men
ride
the
forest
one
them
tried
kill
saw
the
Horned
King
himself
was
horrible
worse
than
Dallben
told
Gwydion
eyes
narrowed
Who
are
you
demanded
Who
are
you
speak
Dallben
Taran
Caer
Dallben
Taran
answered
trying
appear
bold
but
succeeding
only
turning
paler
than
mushroom
Caer
Dallben
Gwydion
paused
instant
and
gave
Taran
strange
glance
What
are
you
doing
far
from
there
Does
Dallben
know
you
are
the
forest
Coll
with
you
Taran
jaw
dropped
and
looked
thunderstruck
that
Gwydion
threw
back
his
head
and
burst
into
laughter
You
need
not
surprised
Gwydion
said
know
Coll
and
Dallben
well
And
they
are
too
wise
let
you
wander
here
alone
Have
you
run
off
then
warn
you
Dallben
not
one
disobeyed
was
Hen
Wen
Taran
protested

have
known

her
Now
she
gone
and

Assistant
Pig
Keeper
Gone
Gwydion
face
tightened
Where
What
has
happened
her

know
Taran
cried
She
somewhere
the
forest
poured
out
account
the
morning
events
Gwydion
listened
intently
had
not
foreseen
this
Gwydion
murmured
when
Taran
had
finished
mission
fails
she
not
found
quickly
turned
abruptly
Taran
Yes
said
too
seek
Hen
Wen
You
cried
Taran
You

she
alone
possesses
Gwydion
said
quickly
have
journeyed
month
from
Caer
Dathyl
get
have
been
followed
spied

And
now
added
with
bitter
laugh
she
has
run
off
Very
well
She
will
found
must
discover
all
she
knows
the
Horned
King
Gwydion
hesitated
fear
himself
searches
for
her
even
now
must
continued
Hen
Wen
sensed
him
near
Caer
Dallben
and
fled
terror
Then
should
stop
him
Taran
declared
Attack
him
strike
him
down
Give
sword
and
will
stand
with
you
Gently
gently
chided
Gwydion
not
say
life
worth
more
than
another
man
but
prize
highly
you
think
lone
warrior
and
one
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
dare
attack
the
Horned
King
and
his
war
band
Taran
drew
himself
would
not
fear
him
said
Gwydion
Then
you
are
fool
the
man
most
dreaded
all
Prydain
Will
you
hear
something
learned
during
journey
something
even
Dallben
may
not
yet
realize
Gwydion
knelt
the
turf
you
know
the
craft
weaving
Thread
thread
the
pattern
forms
spoke
plucked
the
long
blades
grass
knotting
them
form
mesh
That
cleverly
done
said
Taran
watching
Gwydion
rapidly
moving
fingers
May
look
There
more
serious
weaving
said
Gwydion
slipping
the
net
into
his
own
jacket
You
have
seen
one
thread
pattern
loomed
Annuvin
Arawn
does
not
long
abandon
Annuvin
Gwydion
continued
but
his
hand
reaches
everywhere
There
are
chieftains
whose
lust
for
power
goads
them
like
sword
point
certain
them
Arawn
promises
wealth
and
dominion
playing
their
greed
bard
plays
harp
Arawn
corruption
burns
every
human
feeling
from
their
hearts
and
they
become
his
liegemen
serving
him
beyond
the
borders
Annuvin
and
bound
him
forever
And
the
Horned
King
Gwydion
nodded
Yes
know
beyond
question
that
has
sworn
his
allegiance
Arawn
Arawn
avowed
champion
Once
again
the
power
Annuvin
threatens
Prydain
Taran
could
only
stare
speechless
Gwydion
turned
him
When
the
time
ripe
the
Horned
King
and
will
meet
And
one
will
die
That
oath
But
his
purpose
dark
and
unknown
and
must
learn
from
Hen
Wen
She
can
far
Taran
cried
show
you
where
she
disappeared
think
can
find
the
place
was
just
before
the
Horned
King
Gwydion
gave
him
hard
smile
you

the

owl

nightfall
sleep
here
and
shall
off

With
good
luck
may
have
her
back
before
What
Taran
interrupted
Hen
Wen
charge
let
her
escape
and
who
must
find
her
The
task
counts
more
than
the
one
who
does
said
Gwydion
will
not
hindered
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
who
seems
eager
bring
himself
grief
stopped
short
and
looked
wryly
Taran
second
thought
appears
will
the
Horned
King
rides
toward
Caer
Dallben
cannot
send
you
back
alone
and
dare
not
with
you
and
lose
day
tracking
You
cannot
stay
this
forest
yourself
Unless
find
some
way
swear
will
not
hinder
you
cried
Taran
Let
with
you
Dallben
and
Coll
will
see
can
what
set
out
Have
another
choice
asked
Gwydion
would
seem
Taran
Caer
Dallben
follow
the
same
path
For
little
while

The
white
horse
trotted
and
nuzzled
Gwydion
hand
Melyngar
reminds
time
for
food
Gwydion
said
unpacked
provisions
from
the
saddlebags
Make
fire
tonight
warned
The
Horned
King
outriders
may
close
hand
Taran
swallowed
hurried
meal
Excitement
robbed
him
appetite
and
was
impatient
for
dawn
His
wound
had
stiffened
that
could
not
settle
himself
the
roots
and
pebbles
had
never
occurred
him
until
now
that
hero
would
sleep
the
ground
Gwydion
watchful
sat
with
his
knees
drawn
his
back
against
enormous
elm
the
lowering
dusk
Taran
could
barely
distinguish
the
man
from
the
tree
and
could
have
walked
within
pace
him
before
realizing
was
any
more
than
splotch
shadow
Gwydion
had
sunk
into
the
forest
itself
only
his
green
flecked
eyes
shone
the
reflection
the
newly
risen
moon
Gwydion
was
silent
and
thoughtful
for
long
while
you
are
Taran
Caer
Dallben
said
last
His
voice
from
the
shadows
was
quiet
but
urgent
How
long
have
you
been
with
Dallben
Who
are
your
kinsmen
Taran
hunched
against
tree
root
pulled
his
cloak
closer
about
his
shoulders
have
always
lived
Caer
Dallben
said
don
think
have
any
kinsmen
don
know
who
parents
were
Dallben
has
never
told
suppose
added
turning
his
face
away
don
even
know
who
way
answered
Gwydion
that
something
must
all
discover
for
ourselves
Our
meeting
was
fortunate
went
Thanks
you
know
little
more
than
did
and
you
have
spared
wasted
journey
Caer
Dallben
makes
wonder
Gwydion
went
with
laugh
that
was
not
unkind
there
destiny
laid
that
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
should
help
quest
hesitated
mused
perhaps
the
other
way
around
What
you
mean
Taran
asked
not
sure
said
Gwydion
makes
difference
Sleep
now
for
rise
early
tomorrow
Chapter
Gurgi
THE
TIME
Taran
woke
Gwydion
had
already
saddled
Melyngar
The
cloak
Taran
had
slept
was
damp
with
dew
Every
joint
ached
from
his
night
the
hard
ground
With
Gwydion
urging
Taran
stumbled
toward
the
horse
white
blur
the
gray
pink
dawn
Gwydion
hauled
Taran
into
the
saddle
behind
him
spoke
quiet
command
and
the
white
steed
moved
quickly
into
the
rising
mist
Gwydion
was
seeking
the
spot
where
Taran
had
last
seen
Hen
Wen
But
long
before
they
had
reached
reined
Melyngar
and
dismounted
Taran
watched
Gwydion
knelt
and
sighted
along
the
turf
Luck
with
said
think
have
struck
her
trail
Gwydion
pointed
faint
circle
trampled
grass
Here
she
slept
and
not
too
long
ago
strode
few
paces
forward
scanning
every
broken
twig
and
blade
grass
Despite
Taran
disappointment
finding
the
Lord
Gwydion
dressed
coarse
jacket
and
mud
spattered
boots
followed
the
man
with
growing
admiration
Nothing
Taran
saw
escaped
Gwydion
eyes
Like
lean
gray
wolf
moved
silently
and
easily
little
way
Gwydion
stopped
raised
his
shaggy
head
and
narrowed
his
eyes
toward
distant
ridge
The
trail
not
clear
said
frowning
can
only
guess
she
might
have
gone
down
the
slope
With
all
the
forest
run
Taran
queried
how
can
begin
search
She
might
have
gone
anywhere
Prydain
Not
quite
answered
Gwydion
may
not
know
where
she
went
but
can
sure
where
she
did
not
pulled
hunting
knife
from
his
belt
Here
will
show
you
Gwydion
knelt
and
quickly
traced
lines
the
earth
These
are
the
Eagle
Mountains
said
with
touch
longing
his
voice
own
land
the
north
Here
Great
Avren
flows
See
how
turns
west
before
reaches
the
sea
may
have
cross
before
our
search
ends
And
this
the
River
Ystrad
Its
valley
leads
north
Caer
Dathyl
But
see
here
Gwydion
went
pointing
the
left
the
line
had
drawn
for
the
River
Ystrad
here
Mount
Dragon
and
the
domain
Arawn
Hen
Wen
would
shun
this
above
all
She
was
too
long
captive
Annuvin
she
would
never
venture
near
Was
Hen
Annuvin
Taran
asked
with
surprise
But
how
Long
ago
Gwydion
said
Hen
Wen
lived
among
the
race
men
She
belonged
farmer
who
had
idea
all
her
powers
And
she
might
have
spent
her
days
any
ordinary
pig
But
Arawn
knew
her
far
from
ordinary
and
such
value
that
himself
rode
out
Annuvin
and
seized
her
What
dire
things
happened
while
she
was
prisoner
Arawn
better
not
speak
them
Poor
Hen
Taran
said
must
have
been
terrible
for
her
But
how
did
she
escape
She
did
not
escape
said
Gwydion
She
was
rescued
warrior
went
alone
into
the
depths
Annuvin
and
brought
her
back
safely
That
was
brave
deed
Taran
cried
wish
that
The
bards
the
north
still
sing
Gwydion
said
His
name
shall
never
forgotten
Who
was
Taran
demanded
Gwydion
looked
closely
him
you
not
know
asked
Dallben
has
neglected
your
education
was
Coll
said
Coll
Son
Collfrewr
Coll
Taran
cried
Not
the
same
The
same
said
Gwydion
But
but
Taran
stammered
Coll
hero
But
bald
Gwydion
laughed
and
shook
his
head
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
said
you
have
curious
notions
about
heroes

never
known

Crestfallen
Taran

and
said
more
Here
continued
Gwydion
not

from
Annuvin

This

Hen

would
avoid

She

Arawn

But
there

secrets
concerning

Gwydion
went
Hen

Annuvin
Spiral
Castle
From
what
little
can
see
she
has
run
straight
ahead
Quickly
now
shall
try

her
trail
Gwydion
turned
Melyngar
toward
the
ridge
they
reached
the
bottom

slope
Taran
heard
the

Gwydion
said
Her

move
slowly
and
carefully
Stay
close
behind
ordered
you
start
dashing
ahead
and
you
seem
have
that
tendency
you
will
trample
out
any
signs
she
might
have
left
Taran
obediently
walked
few
paces
behind
Gwydion
made
more
sound
than
the
shadow

Melyngar
herself
stepped
quietly
hardly

snapped
under
her

Try

Taran
could
not
silently
The
more
careful
attempted
the
louder
the
leaves
rattled
and
crackled
Wherever
put
his
foot
there
seemed

spiteful
branch

him
Even
Melyngar
turned
and
gave
him
reproachful
look
Taran
grew
absorbed
not
making
noise
that
soon
lagged
far
behind
Gwydion
the
slope
Taran
believed
could
make
out
something
round
and
white
yearned
the
first
find
Hen
Wen
and
turned
aside
clambered
through
the
weeds
discover
nothing
more
than
boulder
Disappointed
Taran
hastened
catch
with
Gwydion
Overhead
the
branches
rustled
stopped
and
looked
something
fell
heavily
the
ground
behind
him
Two
hairy
and
powerful
hands
locked
around
his
throat
Whatever
had
seized
him
made
barking
and
snorting
noises
Taran
forced
out
cry
for
help
struggled
with
his
unseen
opponent

flailing
his
legs
and
throwing
himself
from
one
side
the
other
Suddenly

shape
sailed
over
his
head
and
crashed
against
tree
trunk
Taran
dropped
the
ground
and
began
rubbing
his
neck
Gwydion
stood
beside
him
Sprawled
under
the
tree
was
the
strangest
creature
Taran
had
ever
seen
could
not
sure
whether
was
animal
human
decided
was
both
Its
hair
was
matted
and
covered
with
leaves
that
looked
like
owl
nest
need
housecleaning
had
long
skinny
woolly
arms
and
pair
feet
flexible
and
grimy
its
hands
Gwydion
was
watching
the
creature
with
look
severity
and
annoyance
you
said
ordered
you
not
hinder
anyone
under
protection
this
the
creature
set
loud
and
piteous
whining
rolled
his
eyes
and
beat
the
ground
with
his
palms

Gurgi
Gwydion
said
always
lurking
about
one
place
another
not
half
ferocious
looks
not
quarter
fierce
should
like
and
more
nuisance
than
anything
else
Somehow

Taran
had
just
begun
catch
his
breath
was
covered
with
Gurgi
shedding
hair
addition
the
distressing
odor
wet
wolfhound
mighty
prince
the
creature
wailed
Gurgi
sorry
and
now
will
smacked
his
poor
tender
head
the
strong
hands
this
great
lord
with
fearsome
smackings
Yes
yes
that
always
the
way
with
poor
Gurgi
But
what
honor
smacked
the
greatest
warriors
have
intention
smacking
your
poor
tender
head
said
Gwydion
But
may
change
mind
you
not
leave
off
that
whining
and
sniveling
Yes
powerful
lord
Gurgi
cried
See
how
obeys
rapidly
and
instantly
began
crawling
about
hands
and
knees
with
great
agility
Had
Gurgi
owned
tail
Taran
was
sure
would
have
wagged
frantically
Then
Gurgi
pleaded
the
two
strengthful
heroes
will
give
Gurgi
something
eat
joyous
crunchings
and
munchings
Afterward
said
Gwydion
When
you
have
answered
our
questions
afterward
cried
Gurgi
Poor
Gurgi
can
wait
long
long
for
his
crunchings
and
munchings
Many
years
from
now
when
the
great
princes
revel
their
halls
what
feastings
they
will
remember
hungry
wretched
Gurgi
waiting
for
them
How
long
you
wait
for
your
crunchings
and
munchings
Gwydion
said
depends
how
quickly
you
tell
what
want
know
Have
you
seen
white
pig
this
morning
crafty
look
gleamed
Gurgi
close
set
little
eyes
For
the
seeking
piggy
there
are
many
great
lords
the
forest
riding
with
frightening
shouts
They
would
not
cruel
starving
Gurgi
they
would
feed
him
They
would
have
your
head
off
your
shoulders
before
you
could
think
twice
about
Gwydion
said
Did
one
them
wear
antlered
mask
Yes
yes
Gurgi
cried
The
great
horns
You
will
save
miserable
Gurgi
from
hurtful
choppings
set
long
and
dreadful
howling
losing
patience
with
you
warned
Gwydion
Where
the
pig
Gurgi
hears
these
mighty
riders
the
creature
went
yes
with
careful
listenings
from
the
trees
Gurgi
quiet
and
clever
and
one
cares
about
him
But
listens
These
great
warriors
say
they
have
gone
certain
place
but
great
fire
turns
them
away
They
are
not
pleased
and
they
still
seek
piggy
with
outcries
and
horses
Gurgi
said
Gwydion
firmly
where
the
pig
The
piggy
terrible
hunger
pinches
Gurgi
cannot
remember
Was
there
piggy
Gurgi
fainting
and
falling
into
the
bushes
his
poor
tender
head
full
air
from
his
empty
belly
Taran
could
longer
control
his
impatience
Where
Hen
Wen
you
silly
hairy
thing
burst
out
Tell
straight
off
After
the
way
you
jumped
you
deserve
have
your
head
smacked
With
moan
Gurgi
rolled
over
his
back
and
covered
his
face
with
his
arms
Gwydion
turned
severely
Taran
Had
you
followed
orders
you
would
not
have
been
jumped
Leave
him
not
make
him
any
more
frightened
than
Gwydion
looked
down
Gurgi
Very
well
asked
calmly
where
she
fearful
wrath
Gurgi
snuffled
piggy
has
gone
across
the
water
with
swimmings
and
splashings
sat
upright
and
waved
woolly
arm
toward
Great
Avren
you
are
lying
said
Gwydion
shall
soon
find
out
Then
will
surely
come
back
with
wrath
Crunchings
and
munchings
now
mighty
prince
asked
Gurgi
high
tiny
whimper
promised
you
said
Gwydion
Gurgi
wants
the
smaller
one
for
munchings
said
the
creature
with
beady
glance
Taran
you
not
Gwydion
said
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
and
would
disagree
with
you
violently
unbuckled
saddlebag
and
pulled
out
few
strips
dried
meat
which
tossed
Gurgi
off
now
Remember
want
mischief
from
you
Gurgi
snatched
the
food
thrust
between
his
teeth
and
scuttled
tree
trunk
leaping
from
tree
tree
until
was
out
sight
What
disgusting
beast
said
Taran
What
nasty
vicious
not
bad
heart
Gwydion
answered
would
love
wicked
and
terrifying
though
cannot
quite
manage
feels
sorry
for
himself
that
hard
not
angry
with
him
But
there
use
doing
Was
telling
the
truth
about
Hen
Wen
asked
Taran

was
Gwydion
said
feared
The
Horned
King
has
ridden
Caer

burned
Taran
cried
Until
now
had
paid
little
mind
his
home
The
thought
the
white
cottage
flames
his
memory
Dallben
beard
and
the
heroic
Coll
bald
head
touched
him
all
once
Dallben
and
Coll
are
peril
Surely
not
said
Gwydion
Dallben
old
fox
beetle
could
not
creep
into
Caer
Dallben
without
his
knowledge
certain
the
fire
was
something
Dallben
arranged
for
unexpected
visitors
Hen
Wen
the
one
greatest
peril
Our
quest
grows
ever
more
urgent
Gwydion
hastily
continued
The
Horned
King
knows
she
missing
will
pursue
her
Then
Taran
cried
must
find
her
before
does
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
said
Gwydion
that
has
been
far
your
only
sensible
suggestion
Chapter
The
Gwythaints
MELYNGAR
BORE
THEM
swiftly
through
the
fringe
trees
lining
Great
Avren
sloping
banks
They
dismounted
and
hurried
foot
the
direction
Gurgi
had
indicated
Near
jagged
rock
Gwydion
halted
and
gave
cry
triumph
patch
clay
Hen
Wen
tracks
showed
plainly
they
had
been
carved
Good
for
Gurgi
exclaimed
Gwydion
hope
enjoys
his
crunchings
and
munchings
Had
known
would
guide
well
would
have
given
him
extra
share
Yes
she
crossed
here
went
and
shall
the
same
Gwydion
led
Melyngar
forward
The
air
had
suddenly
grown
cold
and
heavy
The
restless
Avren
ran
gray
slashed
with
white
streaks
Clutching
Melyngar
saddle
horn
Taran
stepped
gingerly
from
the
bank
Gwydion
strode
directly
into
the
water
Taran
thinking
easier
get
wet
little
time
hung
back
much
could
until
Melyngar
lunged
ahead
carrying
him
with
her
His
feet
sought
the
river
bottom
stumbled
and
splashed
while
icy
waves
swirled
his
neck
The
current
grew
stronger
coiling
like
gray
serpent
about
Taran
legs
The
bottom
dropped
away
sharply
Taran
lost
his
footing
and
found
himself
wildly
dancing
over
nothing
the
river
seized
him
greedily
Melyngar
began
swim
her
strong
legs
keeping
her
afloat
and
motion
but
the
current
swung
her
around
she
collided
with
Taran
and
forced
him
under
the
water
Let
the
saddle
Gwydion
shouted
above
the
torrent
Swim
clear
her
Water
flooded
Taran
ears
and
nostrils
With
every
gasp
the
river
poured
into
his
lungs
Gwydion
struck
out
after
him
soon
overtook
him
seized
him
the
hair
and
drew
him
toward
the
shallows
heaved
the
dripping
coughing
Taran
onto
the
bank
Melyngar
reaching
shore
little
farther
upstream
trotted
down
join
them
Gwydion
looked
sharply
Taran
told
you
swim
clear
Are
all
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
deaf
well
stubborn
don
know
how
swim
Taran
cried
his
teeth
chattering
violently
Then
why
did
you
not
say
before
started
across
Gwydion
asked
angrily
was
sure
could
learn
Taran
protested
soon
came
Melyngar
hadn
sat
You
must
learn
answer
for
your
own
folly
said
Gwydion
for
Melyngar
she
wiser
now
than
you
can
ever
hope
become
even
should
you
live
man
which
seems
more
and
more
unlikely
Gwydion
swung
into
the
saddle
and
pulled
the
soaked
bedraggled
Taran
Melyngar
hoofs
clicked
over
the
stones
Taran
snuffling
and
shivering
looked
toward
the
waiting
hills
High
against
the
blue
three
winged
shapes
wheeled
and
glided
Gwydion
whose
eyes
were
everywhere
once
caught
sight
them
instantly
Gwythaints
cried
and
turned
Melyngar
sharply
the
right
The
abrupt
change
direction
and
Melyngar
heaving
burst
speed
threw
Taran
off
balance
His
legs
flew
and
landed
flat
the
pebble
strewn
bank
Gwydion
reined
Melyngar
immediately
While
Taran
struggled
his
feet
Gwydion
seized
him
like
sack
meal
and
hauled
him
Melyngar
back
The
gwythaints
which
distance
had
seemed
more
than
dry
leaves
the
wind
grew
larger
and
larger
they
plunged
toward
horse
and
riders
Downward
they
swooped
their
great
black
wings
driving
them
ever
faster
Melyngar
clattered
the
river
bank
The
gwythaints
screamed
above
the
line
trees
Gwydion
thrust
Taran
from
the
saddle
and
leaped
down
Dragging
him
along
Gwydion
dropped
the
earth
under
oak
tree
spreading
branches
The
glittering
wings
beat
against
the
foliage
Taran
glimpsed
curving
beaks
and
talons
merciless
daggers
cried
out
terror
and
hid
his
face
the
gwythaints
veered
off
and
swooped
again
The
leaves
rattled
their
wake
The
creatures
swung
upward
hung
poised
against
the
sky
for
instant
then
climbed
swiftly
and
sped
westward
White
faced
and
trembling
Taran
ventured
raise
his
head
Gwydion
strode
the
river
bank
and
stood
watching
the
gwythaints
flight
Taran
made
his
way
his
companion
side
had
hoped
this
would
not
happen
Gwydion
said
His
face
was
dark
and
grave
Thus
far
have
been
able
avoid
them
Taran
said
nothing
had
clumsily
fallen
off
Melyngar
the
moment
when
speed
counted
most
the
oak
had
behaved
like
child
waited
for
Gwydion
reprimand
but
the
warrior
green
eyes
followed
the
dark
specks
Sooner
later
they
would
have
found
Gwydion
said
They
are
Arawn
spies
and
messengers
the
Eyes
Annuvin
they
are
called
one
stays
long
hidden
from
them
are
lucky
they
were
only
scouting
and
not
blood
hunt
turned
away
the
gwythaints
last
disappeared
Now
they
fly
their
iron
cages
Annuvin
said
Arawn
himself
will
have
news
before
this
day
ends
will
not
idle
only
they
hadn
seen
Taran
moaned
There
use
regretting
what
has
happened
said
Gwydion
they
set
out
again
One
way
another
Arawn
would
have
learned
have
doubt
knew
the
moment
rode
from
Caer
Dathyl
The
gwythaints
are
not
his
only
servants
think
they
must
the
worst
said
Taran
quickening
his
pace
keep
with
Gwydion
Far
from
Gwydion
said
The
errand
the
gwythaints
less
kill
than
bring
information
For
generations
they
have
been
trained
this
Arawn
understands
their
language
and
they
are
his
power
from
the
moment
they
leave
the
egg
Nevertheless
they
are
creatures
flesh
and
blood
and
sword
can
answer
them
There
are
others
whom
sword
means
nothing
Gwydion
said
Among
them
the
Cauldron
Born
who
serve
Arawn
warriors
Are
they
not
men
Taran
asked
They
were
once
replied
Gwydion
They
are
the
dead
whose
bodies
Arawn
steals
from
their
resting
places
the
long
barrows
said
steeps
them
cauldron
give
them
life
again
can
called
life
Like
death
they
are
forever
silent
and
their
only
thought
bring
others
the
same
bondage
Arawn
keeps
them
his
guards
Annuvin
for
their
power
wanes
the
longer
and
farther
they
from
their
master
Yet
from
time
time
Arawn
sends
certain
them
outside
Annuvin
perform
his
most
ruthless
tasks
These
Cauldron
Born
are
utterly
without
mercy
pity
Gwydion
continued
for
Arawn
has
worked
still
greater
evil
upon
them
has
destroyed
their
remembrance
themselves
living
men
They
have
memory
tears
laughter
sorrow
loving
kindness
Among
all
Arawn
deeds
this
one
the
cruelest
AFTER
MUCH
SEARCHING
Gwydion
discovered
Hen
Wen
tracks
once
more
They
led
over
barren
field
then
shallow
ravine
Here
they
stop
said
frowning
Even
stony
ground
there
should
some
trace
but
can
see
nothing
Slowly
and
painstakingly
quartered
the
land
either
side
the
ravine
The
weary
and
discouraged
Taran
could
barely
force
himself
put
one
foot
front
the
other
and
was
glad
the
dusk
obliged
Gwydion
halt
Gwydion
tethered
Melyngar
thicket
Taran
sank
the
ground
and
rested
his
head
his
hands
She
has
disappeared
too
completely
said
Gwydion
bringing
provisions
from
the
saddlebag
Many
things
could
have
happened
Time
too
short
ponder
each
one
What
can
then
Taran
asked
fearfully
there
way
find
her
The
surest
search
not
always
the
shortest
said
Gwydion
and
may
need
the
help
other
hands
before
done
There
ancient
dweller
the
foothills
Eagle
Mountains
His
name
Medwyn
and
said
understands
the
hearts
and
ways
every
creature
Prydain
anyone
should
know
where
Hen
Wen
may
hiding
could
find
him
Taran
began
You
are
right
saying
Gwydion
answered
have
never
seen
him
Others
have
sought
him
and
failed
should
have
only
faint
hope
But
that
better
than
none
all
wind
had
risen
whispering
among
the
black
clusters
trees
From
distance
came
the
lonely
baying
hounds
Gwydion
sat
upright
tense
bowstring
the
Horned
King
cried
Taran
Has
followed
this
closely
Gwydion
shook
his
head
hounds
bell
like
those
save
the
pack
Gwyn
the
Hunter
And
mused
Gwyn
too
rides
abroad
Another
Arawn
servants
asked
Taran
his
voice
betraying
his
anxiety
Gwyn
owes
allegiance
lord
unknown
even
Gwydion
answered
and
one
perhaps
greater
than
Arawn
Gwyn
the
Hunter
rides
alone
with
his
dogs
and
where
rides
slaughter
follows
has
foreknowledge
death
and
battle
and
watches
from
afar
marking
the
fall
warriors
Above
the
cry
the
pack
rose
the
long
clear
notes
hunting
horn
Flung
across
the
sky
the
sound
pierced
Taran
breast
like
cold
blade
terror
Yet
unlike
the
music
itself
the
echoes
from
the
hills
sang
less
fear
than
grief
Fading
they
sighed
that
sunlight
and
birds
bright
mornings
warm
fires
food
and
drink
friendship
and
all
good
things
had
been
lost
beyond
recovery
Gwydion
laid
firm
hand
Taran
brow
Gwyn
music
warning
Gwydion
said
Take
warning
for
whatever
profit
that
knowledge
may
But
not
listen
overmuch
the
echoes
Others
have
done
and
have
wandered
hopeless
ever
since
whinny
from
Melyngar
broke
Taran
sleep
Gwydion
rose
and
went
her
Taran
glimpsed
shadow
dart
behind
bush
sat
quickly
Gwydion
back
was
turned
the
bright
moonlight
the
shadow
moved
again
Choking
back
his
fear
Taran
leaped
his
feet
and
plunged
into
the
undergrowth
Thorns
tore
him
landed
something
that
grappled
frantically
lashed
out
seized
what
felt
like
someone
head
and
unmistakable
odor
wet
wolfhound
assailed
his
nose
Gurgi
Taran
cried
furiously
You
sneaking
The
creature
curled
into
awkward
ball
Taran
began
shaking
him
Enough
enough
Gwydion
called
not
frighten
the
wits
out
the
poor
thing
Save
your
own
life
next
time
Taran
retorted
angrily
Gwydion
while
Gurgi
began
howling
the
top
his
voice
should
have
known
great
war
leader
needs
help
from
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
Unlike
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
Gwydion
said
gently
scorn
the
help
man
And
you
should
know
better
than
jump
into
thorn
bushes
without
first
making
sure
what
you
will
find
Save
your
anger
for
better
purpose
hesitated
and
looked
carefully
Taran
Why
believe
you
did
think
life
was
danger
had
known
was
only
that
stupid
silly
Gurgi
The
fact
you
did
not
Gwydion
said
shall
take
the
intention
for
the
deed
You
may
many
other
things
Taran
Caer
Dallben
but
see
you
are
coward
offer
you
thanks
added
bowing
deeply
And
what
poor
Gurgi
howled
the
creature
thanks
for
him
only
smackings
great
lords
Not
even
small
munching
for
helping
find
piggy
didn
find
any
piggy
Taran
replied
angrily
And
you
ask
you
know
too
much
about
the
Horned
King
wouldn
surprised
you
gone
and
told
him
The
lord
the
great
horns
pursues
wise
miserable
Gurgi
with
leaping
and
galloping
Gurgi
fears
terrible
smackings
and
whackings
follows
kindly
and
mighty
protectors
Faithful
Gurgi
will
not
leave
them
never
And
what
the
Horned
King
Gwydion
asked
quickly
very
angry
whined
Gurgi
Wicked
lords
ride
with
mumblings
and
grumblings
because
they
cannot
find
piggy
Where
are
they
now
asked
Gwydion
Not
far
They
cross
water
but
only
clever
unthanked
Gurgi
knows
where
And
they
light
fires
with
fearsome
blazings
Can
you
lead
them
Gwydion
asked
would
learn
their
plans
Gurgi
whimpered
questioningly
Crunchings
and
munchings
knew
would
get
around
that
said
Taran
Gwydion
saddled
Melyngar
and
clinging
the
shadows
they
set
out
across
the
moonlit
hills
Gurgi
led
the
way
loping
ahead
bent
forward
his
long
arms
dangling
They
crossed
one
deep
valley
then
another
before
Gurgi
halted
ridge
Below
the
wide
plain
blazed
with
torches
and
Taran
saw
great
ring
flames
Crunchings
and
munchings
now
Gurgi
suggested
Disregarding
him
Gwydion
motioned
for
them
all
descend
the
slope
There
was
little
need
for
silence
deep
hollow
drumming
throbbed
over
the
crowded
plain
Horses
whickered
there
came
the
shouts
men
and
the
clank
weapons
Gwydion
crouched
the
bracken
watching
intently
Around
the
fiery
circle
warriors
high
stilts
beat
upraised
swords
against
their
shields
What
are
those
men
Taran
whispered
And
the
wicker
baskets
hanging
from
the
posts
They
are
the
Proud
Walkers
Gwydion
answered
dance
battle
ancient
rite
war
from
the
days
when
men
were
more
than
savages
The
baskets
another
ancient
custom
best
forgotten
But
look
there
Gwydion
cried
suddenly
The
Horned
King
And
there
exclaimed
pointing
the
columns
horsemen
see
the
banners
the
Cantrev
Rheged
The
banners
Dau
Gleddyn
and
Mawr
All
the
cantrevs
the
south
Yes
now
understand
Before
Gwydion
could
speak
again
the
Horned
King
bearing
torch
rode
the
wicker
baskets
and
thrust
the
fire
into
them
Flames
seized
the
osier
cages
billows
foul
smoke
rose
skyward
The
warriors
clashed
their
shields
and
shouted
together
with
one
voice
From
the
baskets
rose
the
agonized
screams
men
Taran
gasped
and
turned
away
have
seen
enough
Gwydion
ordered
Hurry
let
gone
from
here
DAWN
HAD
BROKEN
when
Gwydion
halted
the
edge
barren
field
Until
now
had
not
spoken
Even
Gurgi
had
been
silent
his
eyes
round
with
terror
This
part
what
have
journeyed
far
learn
Gwydion
said
His
face
was
grim
and
pale
Arawn
now
dares
try
force
arms
with
the
Horned
King
his
war
leader
The
Horned
King
has
raised
mighty
host
and
they
will
march
against
The
Sons
Don
are
ill
prepared
for
powerful
enemy
They
must
warned
must
return
Caer
Dathyl
immediately
From
corner
woodland
five
mounted
warriors
cantered
into
the
field
Taran
sprang
The
first
horseman
spurred
his
mount
gallop
Melyngar
whinnied
shrilly
The
warriors
drew
their
swords
Chapter
The
Broken
Sword
GURGI
RAN
OFF
yelping
terror
Gwydion
was
Taran
side
the
first
rider
bore
down
them
With
quick
gesture
Gwydion
thrust
hand
into
his
jacket
and
pulled
out
the
net
grass
Suddenly
the
withered
wisps
grew
larger
longer
shimmering
and
crackling
nearly
blinding
Taran
with
streaks
liquid
flame
The
rider
raised
his
sword
With
shout
Gwydion
hurled
the
dazzling
mesh
into
the
warrior
face
Shrieking
the
rider
dropped
his
sword
and
grappled
the
air
tumbled
from
his
saddle
while
the
mesh
spread
over
his
body
and
clung
him
like
enormous
spiderweb
Gwydion
dragged
the
stupefied
Taran
ash
tree
and
from
his
belt
drew
the
hunting
knife
which
thrust
Taran
hand
This
the
only
weapon
can
spare
cried
Use
well
you
can
His
back
the
tree
Gwydion
faced
the
four
remaining
warriors
The
great
sword
swung
glittering
arc
the
flashing
blade
sang
above
Gwydion
head
The
attackers
drove
against
them
One
horse
reared
For
Taran
there
was
only
vision
hoofs
plunging
his
face
The
rider
chopped
viciously
Taran
head
swung
around
and
struck
again
Blindly
Taran
lashed
out
with
the
knife
Shouting
rage
and
pain
the
rider
clutched
his
leg
and
wheeled
his
horse
away
There
was
sign
Gurgi
but
white
streak
sped
across
the
field
Melyngar
now
had
entered
the
fray
Her
golden
mane
tossing
the
white
mare
whinnied
fearsomely
and
flung
herself
among
the
riders
Her
mighty
flanks
dashed
against
them
crowding
pressing
while
the
steeds
the
war
party
rolled
their
eyes
panic
One
warrior
jerked
frantically
his
reins
turn
his
mount
away
The
animal
sank
its
haunches
Melyngar
reared
her
full
height
her
forelegs
churned
the
air
and
her
sharp
hoofs
slashed
the
rider
who
fell
heavily
earth
Melyngar
spun
about
trampling
the
cowering
horseman
The
three
mounted
warriors
forced
their
way
past
the
frenzied
mare
the
ash
tree
Gwydion
blade
rang
and
clashed
among
the
leaves
His
legs
were
though
planted
the
earth
the
shock
the
galloping
riders
could
not
dislodge
him
His
eyes
shone
with
terrible
light
Hold
your
ground
but
little
while
called
Taran
The
sword
whistled
one
rider
gave
choking
cry
The
other
two
did
not
press
the
attack
but
hung
back
for
moment
Hoofbeats
pounded
over
the
meadow
Even
the
attackers
had
begun
withdraw
two
more
riders
galloped
forward
They
reined
their
horses
sharply
dismounted
without
hesitation
and
ran
swiftly
toward
Gwydion
Their
faces
were
pallid
their
eyes
like
stones
Heavy
bands
bronze
circled
their
waists
and
from
these
belts
hung
the
black
thongs
whips
Knobs
bronze
studded
their
breastplates
They
did
not
bear
shield
helmet
Their
mouths
were
frozen
the
hideous
grin
death
Gwydion
sword
flashed
once
more
Fly
cried
Taran
These
are
the
Cauldron
Born
Take
Melyngar
and
ride
from
here
Taran
set
himself
more
firmly
against
the
ash
tree
and
raised
his
knife
another
instant
the
Cauldron
Born
were
upon
them
For
Taran
the
horror
beating
him
like
black
wings
came
not
from
the
livid
features
the
Cauldron
warriors
their
lightless
eyes
but
from
their
ghostly
silence
The
mute
men
swung
their
swords
metal
grated
against
metal
The
relentless
warriors
struck
and
struck
again
Gwydion
blade
leaped
past
one
opponent
guard
and
drove
deep
into
his
heart
The
pale
warrior
made
outcry
blood
followed
Gwydion
ripped
the
weapon
free
the
Cauldron
Born
shook
himself
once
without
grimace
and
moved
again
the
attack
Gwydion
stood
wolf
bay
his
green
eyes
glittering
his
teeth
bared
The
swords
the
Cauldron
Born
beat
against
his
guard
Taran
thrust
one
the
livid
warriors
sword
point
ripped
his
arm
and
sent
the
small
knife
hurtling
into
the
bracken
Blood
streaked
Gwydion
face
where
unlucky
blow
had
slashed
his
cheekbone
and
forehead
Once
his
blade
faltered
and
Cauldron
Born
thrust
his
breast
Gwydion
turned
taking
the
sword
point
his
side
The
pale
warriors
doubled
their
assault
The
great
shaggy
head
bowed
wearily
Gwydion
stumbled
forward
With
mighty
cry
lunged
then
dropped
one
knee
With
his
flagging
strength
fought
raise
the
blade
again
The
Cauldron
Born
flung
aside
their
weapons
seized
him
threw
him
the
ground
and
quickly
bound
him
Now
the
other
two
warriors
approached
One
grasped
Taran
the
throat
the
other
tied
his
hands
behind
him
Taran
was
dragged
Melyngar
and
thrown
across
her
back
where
lay
side
side
with
Gwydion
Are
you
badly
hurt
asked
Gwydion
striving
raise
his
head
Taran
said
but
your
own
wound
grave
not
the
wound
that
pains
said
Gwydion
with
bitter
smile
have
taken
worse
and
lived
Why
did
you
not
flee
ordered
knew
was
powerless
against
the
Cauldron
Born
but
could
have
held
the
ground
for
you
Yet
you
fought
well
enough
Taran
Caer
Dallben
You
are
more
than
war
leader
Taran
whispered
Why
you
keep
the
truth
from
remember
the
net
grass
you
wove
before
crossed
Avren
But
your
hands
today
was
grass
have
ever
seen
what
told
you
The
wisp
grass
yes
little
more
than
that
Dallben
himself
taught
the
use
You
too
are
enchanter
have
certain
skills
Alas
they
are
not
great
enough
defend
myself
against
the
powers
Arawn
Today
added
they
were
not
enough
protect
brave
companion
One
the
Cauldron
Born
spurred
his
horse
alongside
Melyngar
Snatching
the
whip
from
his
belt
lashed
brutally
the
captives
Say
more
Gwydion
whispered
You
will
only
bring
yourself
pain
should
not
meet
again
farewell
THE
PARTY
RODE
LONG
without
halt
Fording
the
shallow
River
Ystrad
the
Cauldron
Born
pressed
tightly
either
side
the
captives
Taran
dared
once
again
speak
Gwydion
but
the
lash
cut
his
words
short
Taran
throat
was
parched
waves
dizziness
threatened
drown
him
could
not
sure
how
long
they
had
ridden
for
lapsed
often
into
feverish
dreams
The
sun
was
still
high
and
was
dimly
aware
hill
with
tall
gray
fortress
looming
its
crest
Melyngar
hoofs
rang
stones
courtyard
opened
before
him
Rough
hands
pulled
him
from
Melyngar
back
and
drove
him
stumbling
down
arching
corridor
Gwydion
was
half
dragged
half
carried
before
him
Taran
tried
catch
with
his
companion
but
the
lash
the
Cauldron
Born
beat
him
his
knees
guard
hauled
him
upright
again
and
kicked
him
forward
length
the
captives
were
led
into
spacious
council
chamber
Torches
flickered
from
walls
hung
with
scarlet
tapestries
Outside
had
been
full
daylight
here
the
great
windowless
hall
the
chill
and
dampness
night
rose
from
the
cold
flagstones
like
mist
the
far
end
the
hall
throne
carved
black
wood
sat
woman
Her
long
hair
glittered
silver
the
torchlight
Her
face
was
young
and
beautiful
her
pale
skin
seemed
paler
still
above
her
crimson
robe
Jeweled
necklaces
hung
her
throat
gem
studded
bracelets
circled
her
wrists
and
heavy
rings
threw
back
the
flickering
torches
Gwydion
sword
lay
her
feet
The
woman
rose
quickly
What
shame
household
this
she
cried
the
warriors
The
wounds
these
men
are
fresh
and
untended
Someone
shall
answer
for
this
neglect
She
stopped
front
Taran
And
this
lad
can
barely
keep
his
feet
She
clapped
her
hands
Bring
food
and
wine
and
medicine
for
their
injuries
She
turned
again
Taran
Poor
boy
she
said
with
pitying
smile
there
has
been
grievous
mischief
done
today
She
touched
his
wound
with
soft
pale
hand
the
pressure
her
fingers
comforting
warmth
filled
Taran
aching
body
Instead
pain
delicious
sensation
repose
came
over
him
repose
remembered
from
days
long
forgotten
Caer
Dallben
the
warm
bed
his
childhood
drowsy
summer
afternoons
How
you
come
here
she
asked
quietly
crossed
Great
Avren
Taran
began
You
see
what
had
happened
Silence
Gwydion
voice
rang
out
She
Achren
She
sets
trap
for
you
Taran
gasped
For
instant
could
not
believe
such
beauty
concealed
the
evil
which
had
been
warned
Had
Gwydion
mistaken
her
Nevertheless
shut
his
lips
tightly
The
woman
surprise
turned
Gwydion
This
not
courtesy
accuse
thus
Your
wound
excuses
your
conduct
but
there
need
for
anger
Who
are
you
Why
you
Gwydion
eyes
flashed
You
know
well
know
you
Achren
spat
the
name
through
his
bleeding
lips
have
heard
Lord
Gwydion
was
traveling
realm
Beyond
that
Arawn
sent
his
warriors
slay
cried
Gwydion
and
here
they
stand
your
council
hall
you
say
that
you
know
nothing
more
Arawn
sent
warriors
find
not
slay
you
answered
Achren
you
would
not
alive
this
moment
Now
that
see
you
face
face
she
said
her
eyes
Gwydion
glad
such
man
not
bleeding
out
his
life
ditch
For
there
much
have
discuss
and
much
that
you
can
profit
from
you
would
treat
with
said
Gwydion
unbind
and
return
sword
You
make
demands
Achren
asked
gently
Perhaps
you
not
understand
offer
you
something
you
cannot
have
even
loosened
your
hands
and
gave
back
your
weapon
that
Lord
Gwydion
mean
your
life
exchange
for
what
had
thought
bargain
with
another
life
said
Achren
glancing
Taran
But
see
consequence
alive
dead
she
said
there
are
other
pleasanter
ways
bargain
You
not
know
well
you
think
Gwydion
There
future
for
you
beyond
these
gates
Here
can
promise
Your
promises
reek
Annuvin
cried
Gwydion
scorn
them
secret
what
you
are
Achren
face
turned
livid
Hissing
she
struck
Gwydion
and
her
blood
red
nails
raked
his
cheek
Achren
unsheathed
Gwydion
sword
holding
both
hands
she
drove
the
point
toward
his
throat
stopping
only
hair
breadth
from
Gwydion
stood
proudly
his
eyes
blazing
cried
Achren
will
not
slay
you
you
shall
come
wish
had
and
beg
the
mercy
sword
You
scorn
promises
This
promise
will
well
kept
Achren
raised
the
sword
above
her
head
and
smote
with
all
her
force
against
stone
pillar
Sparks
flashed
the
blade
rang
unbroken
With
scream
rage
she
dashed
the
weapon
the
ground
The
sword
shone
still
undamaged
Achren
seized
again
gripping
the
sharp
blade
itself
until
her
hands
ran
scarlet
Her
eyes
rolled
back
into
her
head
her
lips
moved
and
twisted
thunderclap
filled
the
hall
light
burst
like
crimson
sun
and
the
broken
weapon
fell
pieces
the
ground
shall
break
you
Achren
shrieked
She
raised
her
hand
the
Cauldron
Born
and
called
out
strange
harsh
language
The
pale
warriors
strode
forward
and
dragged
Taran
and
Gwydion
from
the
hall
dark
passageway

Taran
struggled
with
his
captors

TARAN
CAME
HIS
SENSES
pile
dirty
straw
which
smelled
though
Gurgi
and
all
his
ancestors
had
slept
few
feet
above
him
pale
yellow
sunlight
shone
through
grating
the
feeble
beam
ended
abruptly
wall
rough
damp
stone
The
shadows
bars
lay
across
the
tiny
patch
light
instead
brightening
the
cell
the
wan
rays
made
appear
only
more
grim
and
closed
Taran
eyes
grew
accustomed
this
yellow
twilight
made
out
heavy
studded
portal
with
slot
the
base
The
cell
itself
was
not
over
three
paces
square
His
head
ached
since
his
hands
were
still
bound
behind
him
could
more
than
guess
the
large
and
throbbing
lump
What
had
happened
Gwydion
dared
not
imagine
After
the
Cauldron
warrior
had
struck
him
Taran
had
regained
consciousness
only
few
moments
before
slipping
once
again
into
whirling
darkness
that
brief
time
vaguely
remembered
opening
his
eyes
and
finding
himself
slung
over
guard
back
His
confused
recollection
included
dim
corridor
with
doors
either
side
Gwydion
had
called
out
him
once
Taran
believed
could
not
recall
his
friend
words
perhaps
even
that
had
been
part
the
nightmare
supposed
Gwydion
had
been
cast
another
dungeon
Taran
fervently
hoped
could
not
shake
off
the
memory
Achren
livid
face
and
horrible
screaming
and
feared
she
might
have
ordered
Gwydion
slain
Still
there
was
good
reason
hope
his
companion
lived
Achren
could
easily
have
cut
his
throat
braved
her
the
council
hall
yet
she
had
held
back
Thus
she
intended
keep
Gwydion
alive
perhaps
Taran
thought
wretchedly
Gwydion
would
better
off
dead
The
idea
the
proud
figure
lying
broken
corpse
filled
Taran
with
grief
that
quickly
turned
rage
staggered
his
feet
lurched
the
door
kicking
battering
himself
against
with
what
little
strength
remained
him
despair
sank
the
damp
ground
his
head
pressed
against
the
unyielding
oaken
planks
rose
again
after
few
moments
and
kicked
the
walls
Gwydion
were
chance
adjoining
cell
Taran
hoped
would
hear
this
signal
But
judged
from
the
dull
and
muffled
sound
that
the
walls
were
too
thick
for
his
feeble
tapping
penetrate
turned
away
flashing
object
fell
through
the
grating
and
dropped
the
stone
floor
Taran
stooped
was
ball
what
seemed
gold
Perplexed
looked
upward
From
the
grating
pair
intensely
blue
eyes
looked
back
him
Please
said
girl
voice
light
and
musical
name
Eilonwy
and
you
don
mind
would
you
throw
bauble
don
want
you
think
baby
playing
with
silly
bauble
because
not
but
sometimes
there
absolutely
nothing
else
around
here
and
slipped
out
hands
when
was
tossing
Little
girl
Taran
interrupted
don
But
not
little
girl
Eilonwy
protested
Haven
just
been
and
finished
telling
you
Are
you
slow
witted
sorry
for
you
terrible
dull
and
stupid
What
your
name
she
went
makes
feel
funny
not
knowing

Wrong

thumbs

Taran
Caer
Dallben
Taran
said
then
wished
had
not
This
realized
could
another
trap
That
lovely
Eilonwy
said
gaily
very
glad
meet
you
suppose
you
lord
warrior
war
leader
bard
monster
Though
haven
had
any
monsters
for
long
time
none
those
said
Taran
feeling
quite
flattered
that
Eilonwy
should
have
taken
him
for
any
one
them
What
else
there
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
Taran
said
bit
his
lip
soon
the
words
were
out
then
excuse
his
loose
tongue
told
himself
could
harm
for
the
girl
know
that
much
How
fascinating
Eilonwy
said
You
the
first
ever
had
unless
that
poor
fellow
the
other
dungeon
one
too
Tell
him
Taran
said
quickly
alive
don
know
said
Eilonwy
peeked
through
the
grating
but
couldn
tell
doesn
move
all
but
should
imagine
alive
otherwise
Achren
would
have
fed
him
the
ravens
Now
please
you
don
mind
right
your
feet
can
pick
your
bauble
Taran
said
because
hands
are
tied
The
blue
eyes
looked
surprised
Well
that
would
account
for
Then
suppose
shall
have
come
and
get
You
can
come
and
get
said
Taran
wearily
Don
you
see
locked
here
course
said
Eilonwy
What
would
the
point
having
someone
dungeon
they
weren
locked
Really
Taran
Caer
Dallben
you
surprise
with
some
your
remarks
don
mean
hurt
your
feelings
asking
but
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
the
kind
work
that
calls
for
great
deal
intelligence
Something
beyond
the
grating
and
out
Taran
vision
swooped
down
and
the
blue
eyes
disappeared
suddenly
Taran
heard
what
took
scuffle
then
high
pitched
little
shriek
followed
larger
shriek
and
moment
two
loud
smacking
The
blue
eyes
did
not
reappear
Taran
flung
himself
back
the
straw
After
time
the
dreadful
silence
and
loneliness
the
tiny
cell
began
suddenly
wish
Eilonwy
would
come
back
She
was
the
most
confusing
person
had
ever
met
and
surely
wicked
everyone
else
the
castle
although
could
not
quite
bring
himself
believe
completely
Nevertheless
longed
for
the
sound
another
voice
even
Eilonwy
prattling
The
grating
above
his
head
darkened
Night
poured
into
the
cell
black
chilly
wave
The
slot
the
heavy
portal
rattled
open
Taran
heard
something
being
slid
into
the
cell
and
crawled
toward
was
shallow
bowl
sniffed
carefully
and
finally
ventured
touch
his
tongue
fearing
all
the
while
that
might
poisoned
food
was
not
food
all
but
only
little
water
warm
and
musty
His
throat
was
parched
that
Taran
disregarded
the
taste
thrust
his
face
into
the
bowl
and
drank
dry
curled
and
tried
sleep
away
his
pain
the
tight
thongs
pinched
but
his
swollen
hands
were
mercifully
numb
Sleep
brought
only
nightmares
and
roused
find
himself
shouting
aloud
settled
down
once
more
Now
there
was
rasping
sound
under
the
straw
Taran
stumbled
his
feet
The
rasping
grew
louder
Move
away
cried
faint
voice
Taran
looked
around
him
dumbfounded
Get
off
the
stone
stepped
backward
The
voice
was
coming
from
the
straw
Well
can
lift
with
you
standing
you
silly
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
the
muffled
voice
complained
Frightened
and
puzzled
Taran
jumped
the
wall
The
pallet
began
rising
upward
loose
flagstone
was
lifted
pushed
aside
and
slender
shadow
emerged
from
the
ground
itself
Who
are
you
Taran
shouted
Who
did
you
expect
said
the
voice
Eilonwy
And
please
don
make
such
racket
told
you
was
coming
back
there
bauble
The
shadow
bent
and
picked
the
luminous
ball
Where
are
you
cried
Taran
can
see
nothing
that
what
bothering
you
Eilonwy
asked
Why
didn
you
say
the
first
place
Instantly
bright
light
filled
the
cell
came
from
the
golden
sphere
the
girl
hand
Taran
blinked
with
amazement
What
that
cried
bauble
said
Eilonwy
How
many
times
have
tell
you
But
but
lights
What
did
you
think
would
Turn
into
bird
and
fly
away
Eilonwy
the
bewildered
Taran
saw
her
for
the
first
time
had
addition
blue
eyes
long
hair
reddish
gold
reaching
her
waist
Her
face
though
smudged
was
delicate
elfin
with
high
cheekbones
Her
short
white
robe
mud
stained
was
girdled
with
silver
links
crescent
moon
silver
hung
from
fine
chain
around
her
neck
She
was
one
two
years
younger
than
but
fully
tall
Eilonwy
put
the
glowing
sphere
the
floor
went
quickly
Taran
and
unknotted
the
thongs
that
bound
him
meant
come
back
sooner
Eilonwy
said
But
Achren
caught
talking
you
She
started
give
whipping
bit
her
Then
she
locked
one
the
chambers
deep
underground
Eilonwy
went
pointing
the
flagstones
There
are
hundreds
them
under
Spiral
Castle
and
all
kinds
galleries
and
little
passages
like
honeycomb
Achren
didn
build
them
this
castle
they
say
once
belonged
great
king
She
thinks
she
knows
all
the
passageways
But
she
doesn
She
hasn
been
half
them
Can
you
imagine
Achren
going
through
tunnel
She
older
than
she
looks
you
know
Eilonwy
giggled
But
know
every
one
and
most
them
connect
with
each
other
took
longer
the
dark
though
because
didn
have
bauble
You
mean
you
live
this
terrible
place
Taran
asked
Naturally
Eilonwy
said
You
don
imagine
want
visit
here
you
Achren
your
mother
Taran
gasped
and
drew
back
fearfully
Certainly
not
cried
the
girl
Eilonwy
daughter
Angharad
daughter
Regat
daughter
such
bother
going
through
all
that
ancestors
she
said
proudly
are
the
Sea
People
the
blood
Llyr
Half
Speech
the
Sea
King
Achren
aunt
though
sometimes
don
think
she
really
aunt
all
Then
what
are
you
doing
here
said
live
here
Eilonwy
answered
must
take
lot
explaining
before
you
understand
anything
parents
died
and
kinsmen
sent
here
Achren
could
teach
enchantress
family
tradition
don
you
see
The
boys
are
war
leaders
and
the
girls
are
enchantresses
Achren
leagued
with
Arawn
Annuvin
cried
Taran
She
evil
loathsome
creature
everybody
knows
that
said
Eilonwy
Sometimes
wish
kinsmen
had
sent
someone
else
But
think
they
must
have
forgotten
about
now
She
noticed
the
deep
slash
his
arm
Where
did
you
get
that
she
asked
don
think
you
know
much
about
fighting
you
let
yourself
get
knocked
about
and
cut
badly
But
don
imagine
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
are
often
called
that
sort
thing
The
girl
tore
strip
from
the
hem
her
robe
and
began
binding
Taran
wound
didn
let
myself
cut
Taran
said
angrily
That
Arawn
doing
your
aunt
don
know
which
and
don
care
One
better
than
the
other
hate
Achren
Eilonwy
burst
out
She
mean
spiteful
person
all
the
people
who
come
here
you
the
only
one
who
the
least
bit
agreeable
talk
and
she
had
you
damaged
That
not
the
end
Taran
said
She
means
kill
friend
she
does
that
said
Eilonwy
sure
she
include
you
Achren
doesn
things
halves
would
shame
you
were
killed
should
very
sorry
know
wouldn
like
happen
Eilonwy
listen
Taran
interrupted
there
are
tunnels
and
passages
under
the
castle
can
you
get
the
other
cells
there
way
outside
course
there
Eilonwy
said
there
way
there
has
way
out
doesn
there
Will
you
help
Taran
asked
important
for
free
this
place
Will
you
show
the
passage
Let
you
escape
Eilonwy
giggled
Wouldn
Achren
furious
that
She
tossed
her
head
would
serve
her
right
for
whipping
and
trying
lock
Yes
yes
she
went
her
eyes
dancing
that
wonderful
idea
would
love
see
her
face
when
she
comes
down
find
you
Yes
that
would
more
fun
than
anything
could
think
Can
you
imagine
Listen
carefully
Taran
said
there
way
you
can
take
companion
Eilonwy
shook
her
head
That
would
very
hard
You
see
some
the
galleries
connect
with
the
ones
leading
the
cells
but
when
you
try
across
what
happens
that
you
start
run
into
passages
that
Never
mind
then
Taran
said
Can
join
him
one
the
passageways
don
see
why
you
want
that
said
the
girl
would
much
simpler
just
and
let
him
out
and
have
him
wait
for
you
beyond
the
castle
don
understand
why
you
want
complicate
things
bad
enough
for
two
people
crawling
about
but
with
three
you
can
imagine
what
that
would
And
you
can
possibly
find
your
way
yourself
Very
well
Taran
said
impatiently
Free
companion
first
only
hope
well
enough
move
isn
then
you
must
come
and
tell
right
away
and
think
some
means
carrying
him
And
there
white
horse
Melyngar
Taran
went
don
know
what
been
done
with
her
She
would
the
stable
Eilonwy
said
Isn
that
where
you
usually
find
horse
Please
Taran
said
you
must
get
her
too
And
weapons
for
Will
you
that
Eilonwy
nodded
quickly
Yes
that
should
very
exciting
She
giggled
again
She
picked
the
glowing
ball
cupped
her
hands
and
once
again
the
cell
was
dark
The
stone
grated
shut
and
only
Eilonwy
silvery
laugh
lingered
behind
Taran
paced
back
and
forth
For
the
first
time
felt
some
hope
though
wondered
how
much
could
count
this
scatterbrained
girl
She
was
likely
forget
what
she
started
out
Worse
she
might
betray
him
Achren
might
another
trap
new
torment
that
promised
him
freedom
only
snatch
away
but
even
Taran
decided
they
could
worse
off
save
his
energy
lay
down
the
straw
and
tried
relax
His
bandaged
arm
longer
pained
him
and
while
was
still
hungry
and
thirsty
the
water
had
drunk
had
taken
some
the
edge
from
his
discomfort
had
idea
how
long
would
take
travel
through
the
underground
galleries
But
time
passed
grew
more
anxious
worked
the
flagstone
the
girl
had
used
would
not
move
though
Taran
efforts
bloodied
his
fingers
sank
again
into
dark
endless
waiting
Eilonwy
did
not
return
Chapter
The
Trap
FROM
THE
CORRIDOR
faint
sound
grew
louder
Taran
hastened
press
his
ear
against
the
slot
the
portal
heard
the
heavy
tread
marching
feet
the
rattle
weapons
straightened
and
stood
with
his
back
the
wall
The
girl
had
betrayed
him
cast
about
for
some
means
defend
himself
for
had
determined
they
would
not
take
him
easily
For
the
sake
having
something
his
hands
Taran
picked
the
dirty
straw
and
held
ready
fling
was
pitiable
defense
and
wished
desperately
for
Gwydion
power
set
ablaze
The
footsteps
continued
feared
then
they
would
enter
the
other
cell
breathed
sigh
relief
when
they
did
not
stop
but
faded
away
toward
what
imagined
the
far
end
the
corridor
Perhaps
the
guard
was
being
changed
turned
away
certain
Eilonwy
would
not
back
and
furious
with
her
and
her
false
promises
She
was
rattlebrained
fool
who
would
undoubtedly
giggle
and
take
great
joke
when
the
Cauldron
Born
came
for
him
buried
his
face
his
hands
could
hear
her
chatter
even
now
Taran
started
again
The
voice
heard
was
real
Must
you
always
sit
the
wrong
stone
said
You
too
heavy
lift
Taran
jumped
and
hurriedly
cleared
the
straw
away
The
flagstone
was
raised
The
light
from
the
golden
ball
was
dim
now
but
enough
for
him
see
that
Eilonwy
looked
pleased
with
herself
Your
companion
free
she
whispered
And
took
Melyngar
from
the
stable
They
are
hidden
the
woods
outside
the
castle
all
done
now
Eilonwy
said
gleefully
They
waiting
for
you
you
get
move
and
stop
looking
you
forgotten
your
own
name
can
and
meet
them
Did
you
find
weapons
Taran
asked
Well
didn
have
chance
look
Eilonwy
said
Really
she
added
you
can
expect
everything
can
you
Eilonwy
held
the
glowing
sphere
close
the
stone
floor
first
she
said
Then
come
down
after
can
put
the
stone
back
place
Then
when
Achren
sends
have
you
killed
there
won
any
trace
all
She
think
you
disappeared
into
thin
air
and
that
will
make
all
the
more
vexing
know
isn
nice
vex
people
purpose
like
handing
them
toad
but
this
much
too
good
miss
and
may
never
have
another
chance
Achren
will
know
you
let
escape
Taran
said
she
won
said
Eilonwy
because
she
think
still
locked
And
she
doesn
know
can
get
out
she
can
know
was
here
But
very
thoughtful
you
say
that
shows
kind
heart
and
think
that
much
more
important
than
being
clever
While
Eilonwy
continued
chatter
away
Taran
lowered
himself
into
the
narrow
opening
The
passage
was
low
discovered
and
was
obliged
crouch
almost
hands
and
knees
Eilonwy
moved
the
stone
into
place
and
then
began
lead
the
way
The
glow
from
the
sphere
showed
walls
hard
packed
earth
Taran
hunched
along
other
galleries
opened
either
side
sure
you
follow
Eilonwy
called
Don
into
any
those
Some
them
branch
off
and
some
them
don
anywhere
all
You
get
lost
and
that
would
useless
thing
you
trying
escape
The
girl
moved
quickly
Taran
had
difficulty
keeping
with
her
Twice
stumbled
over
loose
stones
the
passage
clutched
the
ground
and
pitched
forward
The
little
light
bobbed
ahead
while
behind
him
long
fingers
darkness
grasped
his
heels
could
understand
why
Achren
fortress
was
called
Spiral
Castle
The
narrow
stifling
galleries
turned
endlessly
could
not
sure
whether
they
were
making
real
progress
whether
the
tunnel
was
merely
doubling
back
itself
The
earthen
ceiling
trembled
with
racing
footsteps
just
below
the
guard
room
Eilonwy
whispered
Something
happening
there
Achren
doesn
usually
turn
out
the
guard
the
middle
the
night
They
must
have
gone
the
cells
Taran
said
There
was
lot
commotion
just
before
you
came
They
surely
know
gone
You
must
very
important
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
said
Eilonwy
with
small
laugh
Achren
wouldn
all
that
trouble
unless
Hurry
Taran
urged
she
puts
guard
around
the
castle
never
get
out
wish
you
stop
worrying
Eilonwy
said
You
sound
you
were
having
your
toes
twisted
Achren
can
set
out
all
the
guards
she
wants
She
doesn
know
where
the
mouth
the
tunnel
And
hidden
well
owl
couldn
see
After
all
you
don
think
march
you
out
the
front
gate
you
Despite
her
chattering
Eilonwy
kept
rapid
pace
Taran
bent
close
the
ground
moving
half
touch
keeping
his
eyes
the
faint
glow
skidded
past
sharp
turns
fetched
against
rough
walls
skinned
his
knees
then
had
move
twice
fast
regain
the
ground
had
lost
another
bend
the
passageway
Eilonwy
light
wavered
and
dropped
out
sight
the
moment
darkness
Taran
lost
his
footing
the
ground
rose
steeply
one
side
fell
and
rolled
Before
could
recover
his
balance
was
sliding
rapidly
downward
shower
loose
stones
and
earth
collided
with
outcropping
rock
rolled
again
and
dropped
suddenly
into
the
darkness
landed
heavily
flat
stones
legs
twisted
under
him
Taran
climbed
painfully
his
feet
and
shook
his
head
clear
Suddenly
realized
was
standing
upright
Eilonwy
and
her
light
could
not
seen
called
loudly
dared
After
few
moments
heard
scraping
above
him
and
saw
the
faint
reflection
the
golden
ball
Where
are
you
called
the
girl
Her
voice
seemed
quite
distant
see
Part
the
tunnel
given
way
You
must
have
slipped
into
crevice
not
crevice
Taran
called
fallen
all
the
way
down
into
something
and
deep
Can
you
put
the
light
into
got
get
again
There
were
more
scraping
noises
Yes
Eilonwy
said
you
have
got
yourself
into
mess
The
ground
all
broken
through
here
and
below
there
big
stone
like
shelf
over
your
head
How
did
you
ever
manage
that
don
know
how
replied
Taran
but
certainly
didn
purpose
strange
Eilonwy
said
This
wasn
here
when
came
through
the
first
time
All
that
tramping
must
have
jarred
something
loose
hard
say
don
think
these
tunnels
are
half
solid
they
look
and
neither
the
castle
for
the
matter
that
Achren
always
complaining
about
things
leaking
and
doors
not
closing
right
stop
that
prattling
cried
Taran
clasping
his
head
don
want
hear
about
leaks
and
doors
Show
light
can
climb
out
here
That
the
trouble
the
girl
said
not
quite
sure
you
can
You
see
that
shelf
stone
juts
out
far
and
goes
down
steeply
Can
you
manage
reach
Taran
raised
his
arms
and
jumped
high
could
could
find
handhold
From
Eilonwy
description
and
from
the
massive
shadow
above
feared
the
girl
was
right
could
not
reach
the
stone
and
even
could
have
its
sharp
downward
pitch
would
have
made
impossible
climb
Taran
groaned
with
despair
without
said
Warn
companion
the
castle
alerted
And
what
you
intend
doing
You
can
just
sit
there
like
fly
jug
That
isn
going
help
matters
all
doesn
make
any
difference
about
Taran
said
You
can
find
rope
and
come
back
when
things
are
safe
Who
knows
when
that
will
Achren
sees
there
telling
what
might
happen
And
suppose
couldn
get
back
You
turn
into
skeleton
while
you
waiting
don
know
how
long
takes
for
people
turn
into
skeletons
though
imagine
would
need
some
time
and
you
worse
off
than
before
What
else
cried
Taran
Eilonwy
talk
skeletons
made
his
blood
run
cold
recalled
then
the
sound
Gwyn
the
Hunter
horn
and
the
memory
filled
him
with
grief
and
fear
bowed
his
head
and
turned
his
face
the
rough
wall
That
very
noble
you
said
Eilonwy
but
don
think
really
necessary
not
yet
any
rate
Achren
warriors
come
out
and
start
beating
the
woods
hardly
think
your
friend
would
stay
around
waiting
and
hide
and
find
you
later
should
imagine
That
would
the
sensible
thing
course
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
too
hard
guess
how
his
mind
would
work
not
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
Taran
said
well
none
your
business
what
That
not
very
polite
thing
say
Well
nevertheless
Eilonwy
voice
dismissed
the
matter
The
main
thing
get
you
out
There
nothing
can
Taran
said
caught
here
and
locked
better
than
Achren
ever
planned
Don
say
that
could
tear
robe
and
plait
into
cord
though
tell
you
right
away
wouldn
enjoy
crawling
around
tunnels
without
any
clothes
But
don
think
would
long
enough
strong
enough
suppose
could
cut
off
hair
had
pair
shears
and
add
that
still
wouldn
Won
you
please
quiet
for
while
and
let
think
Wait
going
drop
bauble
down
you
Here
catch
The
golden
sphere
came
hurtling
over
the
ledge
Taran
caught
mid
air
Now
then
Eilonwy
called
what
down
there
just
pit
some
kind
Taran
raised
the
ball
above
his
head
Why
not
hole
all
cried
kind
chamber
There
tunnel
here
too
took
few
paces
can
see
where
ends
big
Stones
rattled
behind
him
instant
later
Eilonwy
dropped
the
ground
Taran
stared
her
disbelief
You
fool
shouted
You
addlepated
What
have
you
done
Now
both
are
trapped
And
you
talk
about
sense
You
haven
Eilonwy
smiled
him
and
waited
until
ran
out
breath
Now
she
said
you
quite
finished
let
explain
something
very
simple
you
there
tunnel
has
some
place
And
wherever
goes
there
very
good
chance
will
better
than
where
are
now
didn
mean
call
you
names
Taran
said
but
added
sorrowfully
there
was
reason
for
you
put
yourself
danger
There
you
again
Eilonwy
said
promised
help
you
escape
and
that
what
doing
understand
about
tunnels
and
shouldn
surprised
this
one
followed
the
same
direction
the
one
above
doesn
have
half
many
galleries
coming
off
And
besides
lot
more
comfortable
Eilonwy
took
the
glowing
sphere
from
Taran
hand
and
stepped
forward
into
the
new
passageway
Still
doubtful
Taran
followed
Chapter
The
Barrow
EILONWY
HAD
SAID
the
passageway
was
more
comfortable
for
they
could
walk
side
side
without
crouching
and
scuttling
like
rabbits
warren
Unlike
those
the
upper
galleries
the
walls
were
lined
with
huge
flat
stones
the
ceiling
was
formed
even
larger
stones
whose
weight
was
supported
upright
slabs
set
intervals
along
the
square
corridor
The
air
too
smelled
slightly
better
musty
had
lain
unstirred
for
ages
but
without
the
choking
closeness
the
tunnels
None
this
comforted
Taran
greatly
Eilonwy
herself
admitted
she
had
never
explored
the
passage
her
blithe
confidence
did
not
convince
him
she
had
the
slightest
notion
where
she
was
going
Nevertheless
the
girl
hurried
along
her
sandals
tapping
and
echoing
the
golden
light
the
bauble
casting
its
rays
through
shadows
that
hung
like
cobwebs
They
passed
few
side
galleries
which
Eilonwy
ignored
straight
the
end
this
one
she
announced
There
bound
something
there
Taran
had
begun
wishing
himself
back
the
chamber
shouldn
have
come
this
far
said
with
frown
should
have
stayed
and
found
some
way
climb
out
now
you
don
even
know
how
long
will
before
this
passage
stops
might
tramping
for
days
Something
else
troubled
him
After
all
their
progress
seemed
the
passageway
should
now
follow
upward
direction
The
tunnel
supposed
bring
out
about
ground
Taran
said
But
haven
stopped
going
down
aren
coming
out
all
only
going
deeper
and
deeper
Eilonwy
paid
attention
his
remarks
But
she
was
soon
obliged
Within
another
few
paces
the
corridor
stopped
abruptly
sealed
wall
boulders
That
what
feared
cried
Taran
dismayed
have
gone
the
end
your
tunnel
that
you
knew
much
about
and
this
what
find
Now
can
only
back
lost
all
our
time
and
better
off
than
when
started
turned
away
while
the
girl
stood
looking
curiously
the
barrier
can
understand
said
Eilonwy
why
anyone
would
the
trouble
building
tunnel
and
not
have
any
place
must
have
been
terrible
amount
work
for
whoever
was
dig
all
and
set
the
rocks
Why
you
suppose
don
know
And
wish
you
stop
wondering
about
things
that
can
make
any
difference
going
back
Taran
said
don
know
how
going
climb
onto
that
shelf
but
can
certainly
lot
more
easily
than
digging
through
wall
Well
said
Eilonwy
very
strange
and
all
sure
don
know
where
are
knew
end
being
lost
could
have
told
you
that
didn
say
was
lost
the
girl
protested
only
said
didn
know
where
was
There
big
difference
When
you
lost
you
really
don
know
where
you
are
When
you
just
don
happen
know
where
you
are
the
moment
that
something
else
know
underneath
Spiral
Castle
and
that
quite
good
for
start
You
splitting
hairs
Taran
said
Lost
lost
You
worse
than
Dallben
Who
Dallben
Dallben
never
mind
His
face
grim
Taran
began
retracing
his
steps
Eilonwy
hurried
join
him
could
have
look
into
one
the
side
passageways
she
called
Taran
disregarded
the
suggestion
Nevertheless
approaching
the
next
branching
gallery
slowed
his
steps
and
peered
briefly
into
the
gloom
ahead
Eilonwy
urged
Let
try
this
one
seems
good
any
Hush
Taran
bent
his
head
and
listened
intently
From
distance
came
faint
whispering
and
rustling
There
something
Well
all
means
let
find
out
what
said
Eilonwy
prodding
Taran
the
back
ahead
will
you
Taran
took
few
cautious
steps
The
passage
here
was
lower
and
seemed
slope
still
further
down
With
Eilonwy
beside
him
continued
gingerly
setting
each
foot
carefully
remembering
the
sudden
sickening
fall
that
had
brought
him
there
the
first
place
The
whispering
became
high
keening
wail
torment
was
though
voices
had
been
spun
out
like
threads
twisted
taut
ready
snap
icy
current
wove
through
the
air
carrying
along
with
hollow
sighs
and
swell
dull
mutterings
There
were
other
sounds
too
raspings
and
shriekings
like
sword
points
dragged
over
stones
Taran
felt
his
hands
tremble
hesitated
moment
and
gestured
for
Eilonwy
stay
behind
him
Give
the
light
whispered
and
wait
for
here
you
think
ghosts
Eilonwy
asked
don
have
any
beans
spit
them
and
that
about
the
only
thing
that
will
really
for
ghost
But
you
know
don
think
ghosts
all
never
heard
one
though
suppose
they
could
sound
like
that
they
wanted
but
don
see
why
they
should
bother
think
wind
making
all
those
noises
Wind
How
could
there
Wait
Taran
said
You
may
right
that
There
might
opening
Closing
his
ears
the
horrifying
sounds
and
preferring
think
them
draughts
air
rather
than
spectral
voices
Taran
quickened
his
pace
Eilonwy
paying
attention
his
order
wait
strode
along
with
him
They
soon
arrived
the
end
the
passage
Once
more
fallen
stones
blocked
their
way
but
this
time
there
was
narrow
jagged
gap
From
the
wailing
grew
louder
and
Taran
felt
cold
ribbon
air
his
face
thrust
the
light
into
the
opening
but
even
the
golden
rays
could
not
pierce
the
curtain
shadows
Taran
slid
cautiously
past
the
barrier
Eilonwy
followed
They
entered
low
ceilinged
chamber
and
they
did
the
light
flickered
under
the
weight
the
darkness
first
Taran
could
make
out
only
indistinct
shapes
touched
with
feeble
green
glow
The
voices
screamed
trembling
rage
Despite
the
chill
wind
Taran
forehead
was
clammy
raised
the
light
and
took
another
step
forward
The
shapes
grew
clearer
Now
distinguished
outlines
shields
hanging
from
the
walls
and
piles
swords
and
spears
His
foot
struck
something
bent
look
and
sprang
back
again
stifling
cry
was
the
withered
corpse
man
warrior
fully
armed
Another
lay
beside
him
and
another
circle
ancient
dead
guarding
high
stone
slab
which
shadowy
figure
lay
full
length
Eilonwy
paid
scant
attention
the
warriors
having
found
something
more
interesting
her
sure
Achren
hasn
any
idea
all
this
here
she
whispered
pointing
heaps
otter
skin
robes
and
great
earthen
jars
overflowing
with
jewels
Weapons
glistened
amid
stacks
helmets
woven
baskets
held
brooches
collarpieces
and
chains
She
have
hauled
out
long
ago
she
loves
jewelry
you
know
though
doesn
become
her
one
bit
Surely
the
barrow
the
king
who
built
this
castle
Taran
said
hushed
voice
stepped
past
the
warriors
and
drew
near
the
figure
the
slab
Rich
raiment
clothed
the
body
polished
stones
glowed
his
broad
belt
The
clawed
hands
still
grasped
the
jeweled
hilt
sword
ready
unsheath
Taran
recoiled
fear
and
horror
The
skull
seemed
grimace
defiance
daring
stranger
despoil
the
royal
treasures
Taran
turned
gust
wind
caught
his
face
think
there
passage
called
there
the
far
wall
ran
the
direction
the
ghostly
cries
Close
the
ground
tunnel
opened
could
smell
fresh
air
and
his
lungs
drank
deeply
Hurry
urged
Taran
snatched
sword
from
warrior
bony
hand
and
scrambled
into
the
tunnel
THE
TUNNEL
WAS
the
narrowest
they
had
encountered
Flat
his
belly
Taran
squeezed
and
fought
his
way
over
the
loose
stones
Behind
him
heard
Eilonwy
gasping
and
struggling
Then
new
sound
began
distant
booming
and
throbbing
The
earth
shuddered
the
pounding
increased
Suddenly
the
passageway
convulsed
the
hidden
roots
trees
sprang
the
ground
split
beneath
Taran
heaving
and
crumbling
another
instant
was
flung
out
the
bottom
rocky
slope
great
crash
resounded
deep
within
the
hill
Spiral
Castle
high
above
him
was
bathed
blue
fire
sudden
gale
nearly
battered
Taran
the
ground
tree
lightning
crackled
the
sky
Behind
him
Eilonwy
called
for
help
She
was
half
half
out
the
narrow
passage
Taran
wrestled
with
the
fallen
stones
the
walls
Spiral
Castle
shook
like
gray
rags
The
towers
lurched
madly
Taran
clawed
away
clumps
earth
and
roots
all
tangled
with
the
sword
Eilonwy
panted
The
scabbard
caught
something
Taran
heaved
the
last
rock
What
sword
said
through
gritted
teeth
seized
Eilonwy
under
the
arms
and
pulled
her
free
Oof
she
gasped
feel
had
all
bones
taken
apart
and
put
together
wrong
The
sword
You
said
you
needed
weapons
didn
you
And
you
took
one
thought
might
well
too
violent
explosion
that
seemed
ripped
from
the
very
center
the
earth
Spiral
Castle
crumbled
itself
The
mighty
stones
its
walls
split
like
twigs
their
jagged
ends
thrusting
the
sky
Then
deep
silence
fell
The
wind
was
still
the
air
oppressive
Thank
you
for
saving
life
said
Eilonwy
For
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
must
say
you
are
quite
courageous
wonderful
when
people
surprise
you
that
way
wonder
what
happened
Achren
she
went
She
really
furious
she
added
with
delighted
laugh
and
probably
blame
everything
for
she
always
punishing
for
things
haven
even
thought
yet
Achren
under
those
stones
she
never
punish
anyone
again
Taran
said
But
don
think
better
stay
find
out
buckled
his
sword
The
blade
Eilonwy
had
taken
from
the
barrow
was
too
long
for
the
girl
wear
comfortably
her
waist
she
had
slung
from
her
shoulder
Taran
looked
the
weapon
with
surprise
Why
that
the
sword
the
king
was
holding
Naturally
said
Eilonwy
should
the
best
one
shouldn
She
picked
the
glowing
sphere
the
far
side
the
castle
what
used
the
castle
Your
friend
down
there
among
those
trees
assuming
waited
for
you
surprised
did
with
all
this
going
They
ran
toward
the
grove
Ahead
Taran
saw
the
shadowy
forms
cloaked
figure
and
white
horse
There
they
are
cried
Gwydion
called
Gwydion
The
moon
swung
from
behind
the
clouds
The
figure
turned
Taran
stopped
short
the
sudden
brightness
and
his
jaw
dropped
had
never
seen
this
man
before

TARAN
SWORD
LEAPED
OUT
The
man
the
cloak
hurriedly
dropped
Melyngar
bridle
and
darted
behind
tree
Taran
swung
the
blade
Pieces
bark
sprayed
the
air
While
the
stranger
ducked
back
and
forth
Taran
slashed
and
thrust
hacking
wildly
bushes
and
branches
You
not
Gwydion
shouted
Never
claimed
was
the
stranger
shouted
back
you
think
Gwydion
you
dreadfully
mistaken
Come
out
there
Taran
ordered
thrusting
again
Certainly
not
while
you
swinging
that
enormous
here
now
watch
that
Great
Belin
was
safer
Achren
dungeon
Come
out
now
you
won
able
Taran
shouted
redoubled
his
attack
ripping
furiously
through
the
underbrush
Truce
Truce
called
the
stranger
You
can
smite
unarmed
man
Eilonwy
who
had
been
few
paces
behind
Taran
ran
and
seized
his
arm
Stop
she
cried
That
way
treat
your
friend
after
went
all
the
bother
rescuing
him
Taran
shook
off
Eilonwy
What
treachery
this
shouted
You
left
companion
die
You
been
with
Achren
all
along
should
have
known
You
better
than
she
With
cry
anguish
raised
his
sword
Eilonwy
ran
sobbing
into
the
woods
Taran
dropped
the
blade
and
stood
with
bowed
head
The
stranger
ventured
from
behind
the
tree
Truce
inquired
again
Believe
known
was
going
cause
all
this
trouble
wouldn
have
listened
that
redheaded
girl
Taran
did
not
raise
his
head
The
stranger
took
few
more
cautious
steps
Humblest
apologies
for
disappointing
you
said
awfully
flattered
you
mistook
for
Prince
Gwydion
There
hardly
any
resemblance
except
possibly
certain
air

Taran
said
bitterly

Those
are

said
the
bard
Especially
one
who
isn
here

from
her
said
There
nothing

can
tell
She
can
lose

the

for

she

Fflewddur
remarked
then
you
letting
her
off
easily
You
may
not
want
her
explanation
but
quite
sure
Gwydion
would
Allow
suggest
you
and
find
her
before
she
strays
too
far
Taran
nodded
Yes
said
coldly
Gwydion
shall
have
justice
turned
his
heel
and
walked
toward
the
trees
Eilonwy
had
gone
great
distance
could
see
the
glow
the
sphere
few
paces
ahead
where
the
girl
sat
boulder
clearing
She
looked
small
and
thin
her
head
was
pressed
into
her
hands
and
her
shoulders
shook
Now
you
made
cry
she
burst
out
Taran
approached
hate
crying
makes
nose
feel
like
melted
icicle
You
hurt
feelings
you
stupid
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
and
all
for
something
that
your
own
fault
begin
with
Taran
was
taken
aback
that
began
stammer
Yes
cried
Eilonwy
every
bit
your
fault
You
were
close
mouthed
about
the
man
you
wanted
rescue
and
you
kept
talking
about
your
friend
the
other
cell
Very
well
rescued
whoever
was
the
other
cell
You
didn
tell
there
was
anyone
else
the
dungeon
There
wasn
Eilonwy
insisted
Fflewddur
Fflam
whatever
calls
himself
was
the
only
one
Then
where
companion
Taran
demanded
Where
Gwydion
don
know
Eilonwy
said
wasn
Achren
dungeon
that
sure
What
more
never
was
Taran
realized
the
girl
was
speaking
the
truth
his
memory
returned
recalled
that
Gwydion
had
been
with
him
only
briefly
had
not
seen
the
guards
put
him
cell
Taran
had
only
guessed
that
What
could
she
have
done
with
him
haven
any
idea
the
world
Eilonwy
said
and
sniffed
She
could
have
brought
him
her
chambers
locked
him
the
tower
there
dozen
places
she
could
have
hidden
him
All
you
needed
say
was
and
rescue
man
named
Gwydion
and
would
have
found
him
But
you
had
clever
about
and
keep
everything
yourself
Taran
heart
sank
must
back
the
castle
and
find
him
Will
you
show
where
Achren
might
have
imprisoned
him
There
nothing
left
the
castle
said
Eilonwy
Besides
not
sure
going
help
you
any
more
all
after
the
way
you
behaved
and
calling
those
horrid
names
that
like
putting
caterpillars
somebody
hair
She
tossed
her
head
put
her
chin
the
air
and
refused
look
him
accused
you
falsely
Taran
said
shame
deep
sorrow
Eilonwy
without
lowering
her
chin
gave
him
sidelong
glance
should
think
would
shall
seek
him
alone
said
Taran
You
are
right
refusing
help
concern
yours
turned
and
started
out
the
clearing
Well
you
don
have
agree
with
quickly
Eilonwy
cried
She
slid
off
the
boulder
and
hastened
after
him
Fflewddur
Fflam
was
still
waiting
when
they
returned
the
light
Eilonwy
sphere
Taran
had
better
view
this
unexpected
arrival
The
bard
was
tall
and
lanky
with
long
pointed
nose
His
great
shock
bright
yellow
hair
burst
out
all
directions
like
ragged
sun
His
jacket
and
leggings
were
patched
knees
and
elbows
and
sewn
with
large
clumsy
stitches
the
work
Taran
was
certain
the
bard
himself
harp
with
beautiful
sweeping
curve
was
slung
from
his
shoulders
but
otherwise
looked
nothing
all
like
the
bards
Taran
had
learned
about
from
The
Book
Three
seems
that
been
rescued
mistake
Fflewddur
said
after
Taran
explained
what
had
happened
should
have
known
would
turn
out
something
like
that
kept
asking
myself
crawling
along
those
beastly
tunnels
who
could
possibly
interested
whether
was
languishing
dungeon
not
going
back
the
castle
Taran
said
There
may
hope
that
Gwydion
still
lives
all
means
cried
the
bard
his
eyes
lighting
Fflam
the
rescue
Storm

much
left
storm
said
Eilonwy
said
Fflewddur
with
disappointment
Very
well
shall
the
best
can
THE
SUMMIT
the
hill
the
mighty
blocks
stone
lay
crushed
giant
fist
Only
the
square
arch
the
gate
remained
upright
gaunt
bone
the
moonlight
the
ruins
seemed
already
ancient
Shreds
mist
hung
over
the
shattered
tower
Achren
had
learned
his
escape
Taran
guessed
for
the
moment
the
castle
destruction
she
had
sent
out
company
guards
Amid
the
rubble
their
bodies
sprawled
motionless
the
stones
With
growing
despair
Taran
climbed
over
the
ruins
The
foundations
the
castle
had
collapsed
The
walls
had
fallen
inward
The
bard
and
Eilonwy
helped
Taran
try
shift
one
two
the
broken
rocks
but
the
work
was
beyond
their
strength
last
the
exhausted
Taran
shook
his
head
can
more
murmured
This
shall
stand
Gwydion
burial
mound
stood
moment
looking
silently
over
the
desolation
then
turned
away
Fflewddur
suggested
taking
weapons
from
the
bodies
the
guards
equipped
himself
with
dagger
sword
and
spear
addition
the
blade
she
had
taken
from
the
barrow
Eilonwy
carried
slim
dagger
her
waist
Taran
collected
many
bows
and
quivers
arrows
could
carry
The
group
was
now
lightly
but
effectively
armed
With
heavy
hearts
the
little
band
made
their
way
down
the
slope
Melyngar
followed
docilely
her
head
bowed
she
understood
that
she
would
not
see
her
master
again
must
leave
this
evil
place
Taran
cried
impatient
gone
from
here
Spiral
Castle
has
brought
only
grief
have
wish
see
again
What
has
brought
the
rest
Eilonwy
asked
You
make
sound
though
were
just
sitting
around
having
splendid
time
while
you
moan
and
take
Taran
stopped
abruptly
sorry
said
didn
mean
that
way
Furthermore
said
Eilonwy
you
mistaken
you
think
going
marching
through
the
woods
the
middle
the
night
And
put
Fflewddur
don
mind
telling
you
tired
could
sleep
Achren
doorstep
all
need
rest
Taran
said
But
don
trust
Achren
alive
dead
and
still
know
nothing
the
Cauldron
Born
they
escaped
they
may
looking
for
right
now
matter
how
tired
are
would
foolhardy
stay
this
close
Eilonwy
and
Fflewddur
agreed
continue
for
little
distance
After
time
they
found
spot
well
protected
trees
and
flung
themselves
wearily
the
turf
Taran
unsaddled
Melyngar
thankful
the
girl
had
thought
bring
along
Gwydion
gear
found
cloak
the
saddlebag
and
handed
Eilonwy
The
bard
wrapped
himself
his
own
tattered
garment
and
set
his
harp
carefully
gnarled
root
Taran
stood
the
first
watch
Thoughts
the
livid
warriors
still
haunted
him
and
saw
their
faces
every
shadow
the
night
wore
the
passage
forest
creature
the
restless
sighing
wind
the
leaves
made
him
start
The
bushes
rustled
This
time
was
not
the
wind
heard
faint
scratching
and
his
hand
flew
his
sword
figure
bounded
into
the
moonlight
and
rolled
Taran
Crunchings
and
munchings
whimpered
voice
Who
your
peculiar
friend
asked
the
bard
sitting
and
looking
curiously
this
new
arrival
For
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
remarked
Eilonwy
you
keep
strange
company
Where
did
you
find
And
what
never
seen
anything
like
that
life
friend
mine
cried
Taran
miserable
sneaking
wretch
who
deserted
soon
were
attacked
Gurgi
protested
whimpering
and
bobbing
his
matted
head
Poor
humble
Gurgi
always
faithful
mighty
lords
what
joy
serve
them
even
with
shakings
and
breakings
Tell
the
truth
said
Taran
You
ran
off
when
needed
you
most
Slashings
and
gashings
are
for
noble
lords
not
for
poor
weak
Gurgi
fearsome
whistlings
blades
Gurgi
ran
look
for
help
mighty
lord
You
didn
succeed
finding
any
Taran
said
angrily
sadness
Gurgi
moaned
There
was
help
for
brave
warriors
Gurgi
went
far
far
with
great
squeakings
and
shriekings
sure
you
did
Taran
said
What
else
can
unhappy
Gurgi
sorry
see
great
warriors
distress
tears
misery
But
battle
what
would
there
for
poor
Gurgi
except
hurtful
guttings
and
cuttings
his
throat
wasn
very
brave
said
Eilonwy
but
wasn
altogether
stupid
either
don
see
what
advantage
there
was
for
him
chopped
especially
wasn
any
help
you
the
first
place
wisdom
noble
lady
Gurgi
cried
throwing
himself
Eilonwy
feet
Gurgi
had
not
gone
seeking
help
would
not
here
serve
you
now
But
here
Yes
yes
faithful
Gurgi
returns
beatings
and
bruisings
from
the
terrifying
warrior
Just
keep
out
sight
Taran
said
you
really
will
have
something
complain
about
Gurgi
snuffled
Gurgi
hastens
obey
mighty
lord
will
say
more
not
even
whisperings
what
saw
will
not
disturb
the
sleepings
powerful
heroes
See
how
leaves
with
tearful
farewells
Come
back
here
immediately
Taran
called
Gurgi
brightened
Crunchings
Listen
Taran
said
there
hardly
enough
round
but
give
you
fair
share
what
have
After
that
you
have
find
your
own
munchings
Gurgi
nodded
Many
more
hosts
march
the
valley
with
sharp
spears
many
more
Gurgi
watches
quietly
and
cleverly
does
not
ask
them
for
help
they
would
only
give
harmful
hurtings
What
this
what
this
cried
Fflewddur
great
host
should
love
see
them
always
enjoy
processions
and
that
sort
thing
The
enemies
the
House
Don
are
gathering
Taran
hurriedly
told
the
bard
Gwydion
and
saw
them
before
were
captured
Now
Gurgi
speaks
the
truth
they
have
gathered
reinforcements
The
bard
sprang
his
feet
Fflam
never
shrinks
from
danger
The
mightier
the
foe
the
greater
the
glory
shall
seek
them
out
set
upon
them
The
bards
shall
sing
our
praises
forever
Carried
away
Fflewddur
enthusiasm
Taran
seized
his
sword
Then
shook
his
head
remembering
Gwydion
words
the
forest
near
Caer
Dallben
said
slowly
would
folly
think
attacking
them
smiled
quickly
Fflewddur
The
bards
would
sing
admitted
but
position
appreciate
Fflewddur
sat
down
again
disappointed
You
can
talk
about
the
bards
singing
your
praises
all
you
want
said
Eilonwy
mood
battle
going
sleep
With
that
she
curled
the
ground
and
pulled
the
cloak
over
her
head
Still
unconvinced
Fflewddur
settled
himself
against
tree
root
for
his
turn
guard
Gurgi
curled
Eilonwy
feet
Exhausted
though
was
Taran
lay
awake
his
mind
saw
again
the
Horned
King
and
heard
the
screams
from
the
flaming
cages
sat
quickly
Grieving
for
his
companion
had
forgotten
what
had
brought
him
here
His
own
quest
had
been
for
Hen
Wen
Gwydion
warn
the
Sons
Don
Taran
head
spun
With
his
companion
surely
dead
should
now
try
make
his
way
Caer
Dathyl
What
then
would
become
Hen
Wen
Everything
had
ceased
simple
yearned
for
the
peacefulness
Caer
Dallben
yearned
even
weed
the
vegetable
gardens
and
make
horseshoes
turned
restlessly
finding
answer
last
his
weariness
overcame
him
and
slept
plunged
nightmares
Chapter
The
Sword
Dyrnwyn
WAS
FULL
DAYLIGHT
when
Taran
opened
his
eyes
Gurgi
was
already
sniffing
hungrily
the
saddlebag
Taran
rose
quickly
and
shared
out
much
the
remaining
provisions
dared
keeping
small
amount
reserve
since
had
idea
how
difficult
would
find
food
during
the
coming
journey
the
course
the
restless
night
had
reached
his
decision
though
present
refrained
from
speaking
still
unsure
had
chosen
wisely
For
the
moment
concentrated
meager
breakfast
Gurgi
sitting
crosslegged
devoured
his
food
with
many
outcries
pleasure
and
loud
smackings
his
lips
that
seemed
eating
twice
much
really
did
Fflewddur
bolted
his
scant
portion
though
had
not
enjoyed
meal
for
least
five
days
Eilonwy
was
more
interested
the
sword
she
had
taken
from
the
barrow
lay
across
her
knees
and
with
perplexed
frown
the
tip
her
tongue
between
her
lips
the
girl
was
studying
the
weapon
curiously
Taran
drew
near
Eilonwy
snatched
the
sword
away
Well
said
Taran
with
laugh
you
needn
act
were
going
steal
from
you
Although
jewels
studded
the
hilt
and
pommel
the
scabbard
was
battered
discolored
nearly
black
with
age
For
all
that
had
air
ancient
lineage
and
Taran
was
eager
hold
Come
said
let
see
the
blade
dare
not
cried
Eilonwy
Taran
great
surprise
saw
that
her
face
was
solemn
and
almost
fearful
There
symbol
power
the
scabbard
Eilonwy
continued
seen
this
mark
before
some
Achren
things
always
means
something
forbidden
course
all
Achren
things
are
like
that
but
some
are
more
forbidden
than
others
There
another
inscription
too
said
Eilonwy
frowning
again
But
the
Old
Writing
She
stamped
her
foot
wish
Achren
had
finished
teaching
can
almost
make
out
but
not
quite
and
there
nothing
more
irritating
like
not
finishing
what
you
started
out
say
Fflewddur
came
just
then
and
too
peered
the
strange
weapon
Comes
from
barrow
The
bard
shook
his
spiky
yellow
head
and
whistled
suggest
getting
rid
immediately
Never
had
much
confidence
things
you
find
barrows
bad
business
having
anything
with
them
You
can
sure
where
else
they
been
and
who
all
had
them
enchanted
weapon
Taran
began
more
interested
than
ever
getting
his
hands
the
sword
shouldn
keep
quiet
Eilonwy
cried
can
hear
myself
think
don
see
what
you
both
talking
about
getting
rid
not
getting
rid
After
all
mine
isn
found
and
carried
out
and
almost
got
stuck
dirty
old
tunnel
because
Bards
are
supposed
understand
these
things
Taran
said
Naturally
Fflewddur
answered
smiling
confidently
and
putting
his
long
nose
closer
the
scabbard
These
inscriptions
are
all
pretty
much
the
same
see
this
one
the
scabbard
rather
than
the
blade
says
something
like
Beware
Wrath
the
usual
sentiments
that
moment
there
was
loud
twang
Fflewddur
blinked
One
his
harp
strings
had
snapped
Excuse
said
and
went
see
about
his
instrument
doesn
say
anything
all
like
that
Eilonwy
declared
can
read
some
now
Here
starts
near
the
hilt
and
goes
winding
around
like
ivy
was
looking
the
wrong
way
says
Dyrnwyn
first
don
know
whether
that
the
name
the
sword
the
name
the
king
yes
that
the
name
the
sword
here
again:
DRAW
DYRNWYN
ONLY
THOU
ROYAL
BLOOD
RULE
STRIKE
THE
Something
other
Eilonwy
went
very
faint
can
see
The
letters
are
worn
too
smooth
that
odd
They
aren
worn
they
been
scratched
out
They
must
have
been
cut
deeply
because
there
still
trace
But
can
read
the
rest
This
word
looks
might
death
She
shuddered
That
not
very
cheerful
Let
unsheath
Taran
urged
again
There
might
more
the
blade
Certainly
not
said
Eilonwy
told
you
had
symbol
power
and
bound
that
elementary
Achren
cannot
bind
you
any
longer
isn
Achren
Eilonwy
answered
only
said
she
had
things
with
the
same
mark
This
stronger
enchantment
than
any
she
could
make
quite
sure
wouldn
dare
draw
and
don
intend
letting
you
either
Besides
says
only
royal
blood
and
doesn
mention
word
about
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
How
can
you
tell
haven
royal
blood
Taran
asked
bristling
wasn
born
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
For
all
you
know
father
might
have
been
king
happens
all
the
time
The
Book
Three
never
heard
The
Book
Three
said
Eilonwy
But
the
first
place
don
think
good
enough
king
son
even
king
himself
Royal
blood
just
way
translating
the
Old
Writing
didn
mean
only
having
royal
relatives
anybody
can
have
those
meant
don
know
what
you
call
Something
very
special
And
seems
that
you
have
you
don
need
wonder
whether
you
have
course
said
Taran
nettled
the
girl
remarks
you
made
your
mind
that
not
whatever
didn
mean
offend
you
Eilonwy
said
quickly
For
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
think
you
quite
remarkable
even
think
you
the
nicest
person
ever
met
life
just
that
forbidden
let
you
have
the
sword
and
that
that
What
will
you
with
then
Keep
naturally
not
going
drop
down
well
Taran
snorted
You
make
fine
sight
little
girl
carrying
sword
not
little
girl
said
Eilonwy
tossing
her
hair
exasperation
Among
people
the
olden
days
the
Sword
Maidens
did
battle
beside
the
men
not
the
olden
days
now
Taran
said
Instead
sword
you
should
carrying
doll
Eilonwy
with
squeal
vexation
raised
hand
slap
Taran
when
Fflewddur
Fflam
returned
Here
now
said
the
bard
squabbling
there
not
bit
use
With
large
key
tightened
the
wooden
peg
holding
the
newly
repaired
harp
string
Eilonwy
turned
her
irritation
Fflewddur
That
inscription
was
very
important
one
didn
say
anything
about
bewaring
anyone
wrath
You
didn
read
right
all
You
fine
bard
you
can
make
out
the
writing
enchanted
sword
Well
you
see
the
truth
the
matter
said
Fflewddur
clearing
his
throat
and
speaking
with
much
hesitation
this
way
not
officially
bard
didn
know
there
were
unofficial
bards
Eilonwy
remarked
yes
indeed
said
Fflewddur
least
case
also
king
king
Taran
said
Sire
dropped
one
knee
None
that
none
that
said
Fflewddur
don
bother
with
any
more
Where
your
kingdom
Eilonwy
asked
Several
days
journey
east
Caer
Dathyl
said
Fflewddur
vast
realm
this
Taran
heard
another
jangling
Drat
the
thing
said
the
bard
There
two
more
strings
was
saying
Yes
well
actually
rather
small
kingdom
the
north
very
dull
and
dreary
gave
always
loved
barding
and
wandering
and
that
what
decided
thought
bards
had
study
great
deal
Eilonwy
said
person
can
just
and
decide
body
