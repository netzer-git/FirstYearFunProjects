There

Since
gave
his

spends
his
days
drugged
stupor
tucked
against
Antimony
like
pup

Sometimes
you
don
ask
for
lessons
when
you
come

Antimony
has
moved
fully
into
the
nest

him

You
can

there

nearly
fifty
people

You
could

you

Now
not
the
time
call

You
look

see
Lerna

His

are
wide

through

catch

subsides

man
rushes
forward
from
the

crouching
beside
the
iced
corpse
and
trying
his
best
fling
his
arms
around
The
resemblance
between
him
and
the
body
obvious
even
through
the
ice:
brothers
perhaps
His
wail
anguish
causes
sudden
flustered
silence
ripple
across
the
crowd
They
shuffle
uneasily
his
wail
subsides
into
deep
soul
tearing
sobs
Ykka
takes
deep
breath
and
steps
forward
using
the
opportunity
that
grief
has
provided
Cutter
she

There

tries

You
see
the

come
over
Ykka
that

You

Penty

She
maybe
ten

with
heavier

and

Waineen

the

Lerna

Sometime
back

lucrative
sideline

Castrimans
perk
their

with
the
obelisk
torrenting
its
power
through
you
begin
killing
everyone
within
and
beyond
your
sight
Something
jars
your
connection
the
obelisk
Suddenly
you
have
fight
for
power
that
readily
gave
you
before
You
bare
your
teeth
without
thinking
growl
without
hearing

clench
your

and
shout
your

But
you
are
sessing
Alabaster
Feeling
him
blazing
white
tendrils
that
lash
your
obelisk

That
Alabaster
strength
contending
against
yours
and
not

does
not
shut
you
down

You
just

stronger

And
suddenly
the

this
slaps
through
the
fugue

and
horror
that
you
trapped
bringing
you

But

His

You

because
the

and
the

disoriented

Someone
shouting

The

Someone
has
brought
out
old
wooden
box
and
people
are
milling
around
talking
each
other
writing
scraps
paper
leather
dropping
these
into
the
box
You
walk
toward
the
Flat
Top
with
Lerna

People
don
notice
you
until
you
nearly
across
the
bridge
Nearly
top
them
Then
someone
sees
you
coming
and
gasps
loudly
Someone
else
yelps

People
scramble
get
out
your
way
almost
tripping
over
themselves
They

with

rejected
you
before
because
you
were
unstable
floundering
but
now
you
know
what
you
need
from
You
found
your
focus
The
spinel
won
hurt
anyone
long
you
don
let
Whether
you
will
not
entirely
different
matter
You
walk
into
the
center
the
circle
and
the
man
holding
the
ballot
box
scrambles
back
from
you
leaving
there
Ykka
frowns
and
steps
forward
and
says
cEssun
But
you
ignore
her
You
lunge
forward
and
suddenly
instinctual
easy
natural
grip
the
hilt
the
pink
longknife
with
both
hands
and
turn
and
swivel
your
hips
and
swing
The
instant
the
sword
touches
the
wooden
box
the
box
obliterated
isn
cut
isn
smashed
disintegrates
into
its
component
microscopic
particles
The
eye
processes
this
dust
which
scatters
and
glitters
the
light
before
vanishing
Turned

people
are
gasping
crying
out
which
means
they
inhaling
their
votes
Probably

Much
Then
you
turn
and
lift
the
longknife
pivoting
slowly

face
