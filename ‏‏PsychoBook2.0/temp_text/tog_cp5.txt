Nassun

AMA
MADE
LIE
YOU
Nassun
thinking
She
looking
her
father
who
been
driving
the
wagon
for
hours
this
point
His
eyes
are
the
road
but
muscle
his
jaw
jumps
One
his
hands
the
one
that
first
struck
Uche
ultimately
killed
him
shaking
where
grips
the
reins
Nassun
can
tell
that
still
caught
the
fury
maybe
still
killing
Uche
his
head
She
doesn
understand
why
and
she
doesn
like
But
she
loves
her
father
fears
him
worships
him
and
therefore
some
part
her
yearns
appease
him
She
asks
herself:
What
did
make
this
happen
And
the
answer
that
comes
is:
Lie
You
lied
and
lies
are
always
bad
But
this
lie
was
not
her
choice
That
had
been
Mama
command
along
with
all
the
others:
Don
reach
don
ice
going
make
the
earth
move
and
you
better
not
react
didn
tell
you
not
react
even
listening
reacting
normal
people
don
listen
like
that
are
you
listening
rusting
stop
for
Earth
sake
can
you
anything
right
stop
crying
now
again
Endless
commands
Endless
displeasure
Occasionally
the
slap
ice
threat
the
slap
hand
the
sickening
inversion
Nassun
torus
the
jerk
hand
her
upper
arm
Mama
has
said
occasionally
that
she
loves
Nassun
but
Nassun
has
never
seen
any
proof
Not
like
Daddy
who
gives
her
knapped
stone
kirkhusa
play
with
first
aid
kit
for
her
runny
sack
because
Nassun
Resistant
like
her
mama
Daddy
who
takes
her
fishing
Tirika
Creek
days
when
doesn
have
commissions
fulfill
Mama
has
never
lain
out
the
grassy
rooftop
with
Nassun
pointing
the
stars
and
explaining
that
some
deadcivs
are
said
have
given
them
names
though
one
remembers
those
Daddy
never
too
tired
talk
the
ends
his
workdays
Daddy
does
not
inspect
Nassun
the
mornings
after
baths
the
way
Mama
does
checking
for
poorly
washed
ears
unmade
bed
and
when
Nassun
misbehaves
Daddy
only
sighs
and
shakes
his
head
and
tells
her
cSweetening
you
knew
better
Because
Nassun
always
does
was
not
because
Daddy
that
Nassun
wanted
run
away
and
become
lorist
She
does
not
like
that
her
father
angry
now
This
seems
yet
another
thing
that
her
mother
has
done
her
she
says
wanted
tell
you
Daddy
does
not
react
The
horses
keep
plodding
forward
The
road
stretches
before
the
cart
the
woods
and
hills
inching
past
around
the
road
the
bright
blue
sky
overhead
There
aren
lot
people
riding
past
today
just
some
carters
with
heavy
wagons
trade
goods
messengers
some
quartent
guards
patrol
few
the
carters
who
visit
Tirimo
often
nod
wave
because
they
know
Daddy
but
Daddy
does
not
respond
Nassun
doesn
like
this
either
Her
father
friendly
man
The
man
who
sits
beside
her
feels
like
stranger
Just
because
doesn
reply
doesn
mean
not
listening
She
adds
asked
Mama
when
could
tell
you
asked
her
that
lot
She
said
never
She
said
you
wouldn
understand
Daddy
says
nothing
His
hands
are
still
shaking
less
now
Nassun
cannot
tell
She
starts
feel
uncertain
angry
sad
about
Uche
(Is
she
sad
about
Uche
does
not
feel
real
When
she
thinks
her
little
brother
she
thinks
gabby
giggly
little
thing
who
sometimes
bit
people
and
still
shit
his
diaper
occasionally
and
who
had
orogenic
presence
the
size
quartent
The
crumpled
still
thing
back
their
house
cannot
Uche
because
was
too
small
and
dull
Nassun
wants
touch
her
father
shaking
hand
but
she
finds
herself
oddly
reluctant
She
isn
sure
why
fear
Maybe
just
because
this
man
much
stranger
and
she
has
always
been
shy
strangers
But
Daddy
Whatever
wrong
with
him
now
Mama
fault
Nassun
reaches
out
and
grips
Daddy
nearer
hand
hard
because
she
wants
show
him
that
she
not
afraid
and
because
she
angry
though
not
Daddy
wanted
tell
you
The
world
blurs
first
Nassun
isn
sure
what
happening
and
she
locks
This
what
Mama
has
drilled
her
moments
surprise
pain:
lock
down
her
body
instinctive
fear
reaction
lock
down
her
sessapinae
instinctive
grab
for
the
earth
below
And
under
circumstances
Nassun
react
with
orogeny
because
normal
people
not
that
You
can
anything
else
Mama
voice
says
her
head
Scream
cry
throw
something
with
your
hands
get
and
start
fight
Not
orogeny
Nassun
hits
the
ground
harder
than
she
should
because
she
has
not
quite
mastered
the
skill
not
reacting
and
she
still
stiffens
physically
along
with
not
reacting
orogenically
And
the
world
blurs
because
she
has
not
only
been
knocked
off
the
driver
seat
the
wagon
but
she
has
actually
rolled
off
the
edge
the
Imperial
Road
and
down
gravel
strewn
slope
toward
small
creek
fed
pond
(The
creek
that
feeds
where
few
days
Essun
will
bathe
strange
white
boy
who
acts
has
forgotten
what
soap
for
Nassun
flops
stop
dazed
and
breathless
Nothing
really
hurts
yet
the
time
the
world
settles
and
she
begins
understand
what
happened
Daddy
hit
knocked
off
the
wagon
Daddy
has
scrambled
down
the
slope
and
crying
her
name
crouches
beside
her
and
helps
her
sit
Really
crying
Nassun
blinks
away
dust
and
the
stars
that
obscure
her
vision
she
reaches
confusion
touch
Daddy
face
and
finds
streaked
wet
sorry
says
sorry
sweetening
don
want

you
don
you
all
have
left
jerks
her
close
and
holds
her
tightly
although
hurts
She
has
bruises
all
over
sorry
rusting
sorry
Earth
Earth
you
evil
son
ruster
Not
this
one
You
can
have
this
one
too
These
are
sobs
grief
long
and
throat
scraping
and
hysterical
Nassun
will
understand
this
later
(and
not
very
much
later
She
will
realize
that
this
moment
her
father
weeping
much
for
the
son
murdered
for
the
daughter
has
injured
the
moment
however
she
thinks
still
loves
and
starts
crying
too
while
they
are
like
this
Daddy
holding
Nassun
tight
Nassun
shaking
with
relief
and
lingering
shock
that
the
rippling
shockwave
the
continent
being
ripped
half
north
reaches
them
They
are
nearly
whole
day
travel
down
the
Imperial
Road
Back
Tirimo
few
moments
previous
Essun
has
just
shunted
the
force
the
wave
that
splits
and
goes
around
the
town
which
means
that
what
comes
Nassun
incrementally
more
powerful
And
Nassun
has
been
knocked
half
insensible
and
she
less
skilled
less
experienced
When
she
sesses
the
onrush
the
shake
and
the
sheer
power
she
reacts
exactly
the
wrong
way:
She
locks
again
Her
father
lifts
his
head
surprised
her
gasp
and
sudden
stiffness
and
that
when
the
hammer
lands
Even
sesses
the
loom
though
comes
too
fast
and
too
powerfully
anything
but
jangle
run
run
RUN
RUN
the
back
his
mind
Running
pointless
The
shake
basically
what
happens
when
person
doing
laundry
flaps
the
wrinkles
out
sheet
writ
continental
scale
and
moving
with
the
speed
and
force
casual
asteroid
strike
the
scale
small
stationary
crushable
people
the
strata
heave
beneath
them
and
the
trees
shake
and
then
splinter
The
water
the
pond
beside
them
actually
leaps
into
the
air
for
moment
suspended
and
still
Daddy
stares
apparently
riveted
this
single
static
point
amid
the
relentless
unpeeling
the
world
everywhere
else
But
Nassun
still
skilled
orogene
even
she
half
addled
one
Though
she
did
not
muster
herself
time
what
Essun
did
and
break
the
force
the
wave
before
hits
she
does
the
next
best
thing
She
drives
invisible
pylons
force
into
the
strata
deep
she
can
grabbing
for
the
very
lithosphere
itself
When
the
kinetic
force
the
wave
hits
incremental
instants
before
the
planetary
crust
above
flexes
reaction
she
snatches
the
heat
and
pressure
and
friction
from
and
uses
this
fuel
her
pylons
pinning
the
strata
and
soil
place
solidly
glued
There
plenty
strength
draw
from
the
earth
but
she
spins
ambient
torus
anyway
She
keeps
wide
remove
because
her
father
within
and
she
cannot
cannot
cannot
hurt
him
and
she
spins
hard
and
vicious
even
though
she
doesn
need
Instinct
tells
her
and
instinct
right
The
freezing
eye
wall
her
torus
which
disintegrates
anything
coming
into
the
stable
zone
its
center
what
keeps
few
dozen
projectiles
from
puncturing
them
death
All
this
means
that
when
the
world
comes
apart
happens
everywhere
else
For
instant
there
nothing
see
reality
save
floating
globule
pond
hurricane
pulverized
everything
else
and
oasis
stillness
the
hurricane
core
Then
the
concussion
passes
The
pond
slaps
back
into
place
spraying
them
with
muddy
snow
The
trees
that
haven
shattered
snap
back
upright
some
them
nearly
bending
all
the
way
the
other
direction
reactive
momentum
and
breaking
there
the
distance
beyond
Nassun
torus
people
and
animals
and
boulders
and
trees
that
have
been
flung
into
the
air
come
crashing
down
There
are
screams
human
and
inhuman
Cracking
wood
crumbling
stone
the
distant
screech
something
man
made
and
metallic
rending
apart
Behind
them
the
far
end
the
valley
they
have
just
left
rock
face
shatters
and
comes
down
avalanche
roar
releasing
large
steaming
chalcedony
geode
Then
there
silence
finally
Nassun
pulls
her
face
from
her
father
shoulder
look
around
She
does
not
know
what
think
Her
father
arms
ease
around
her
shock
and
she
wriggles
until
lets
her
that
she
can
get
her
feet
does
too
For
long
moments
they
simply
stare
around
the
wreckage
the
world
they
once
knew
Then
Daddy
turns
look
her
slowly
and
she
sees
his
face
what
Uche
must
have
seen
those
last
moments
cDid
you
this
asks
The
orogeny
has
cleared
Nassun
head
necessity
survival
mechanism
intense
stimulation
the
sessapinae
usually
accompanied
surge
adrenaline
and
other
physical
changes
that
prepare
the
body
for
flight
sustained
orogeny
that
needed
this
case
brings
increased
clarity
thought
which
how
Nassun
finally
realizes
that
her
father
was
not
hysterical
over
her
fall
purely
for
her
sake
And
that
what
she
sees
his
eyes
right
now
something
entirely
different
from
love
Her
heart
breaks
this
moment
Another
small
quiet
tragedy
amid
many
others
But
she
speaks
because
the
end
she
her
mother
daughter
and
Essun
has
done
nothing
else
she
has
trained
her
little
girl
survive
cThat
was
too
big
Nassun
says
Her
voice
calm
detached
cWhat
did
this
She
gestures
around
them
the
circle
safe
ground
that
surrounds
them
distinct
from
the
chaos
just
beyond
sorry
didn
stop
all
Daddy
tried
The
Daddy
what
works
just
her
tears
saved
her
before
The
murder
his
expression
flickers
fades
twists
can
kill
you
whispers
himself
Nassun
sees
the
waver
him
also
instinct
that
she
steps
forward
and
takes
his
hand
flinches
perhaps
thinking
knocking
her
away
again
but
this
time
she
holds
Daddy
she
says
again
this
time
putting
more
needy
whine
into
her
voice
the
thing
that
has
swayed
him
these
times
when
has
come
near
turning
her:
remembering
that
she
his
little
girl
Reminding
him
that
has
been
today
good
father
manipulation
Something
her
warped
out
true
this
moment
and
from
now
all
her
acts
affection
toward
her
father
will
calculated
performative
Her
childhood
dies
for
all
intents
and
purposes
But
that
better
than
all
her
dying
she
knows
And
works
Jija
blinks
rapidly
then
murmurs
something
unintelligible
himself
His
hand
tightens
hers
cLet
get
back
the
road
says
(He
cJija
now
her
head
will
Jija
hereafter
forever
and
never
Daddy
again
except
out
loud
when
Nassun
needs
reins
steer
him
they
back
Nassun
limping
little
because
her
backside
sore
where
she
landed
too
hard
the
asphalt
and
rocks
The
road
has
been
cracked
all
down
its
length
though
not
bad
the
immediate
vicinity
their
wagon
The
horses
are
still
hitched
though
one
them
has
fallen
her
knees
and
half
entangled
herself
the
tack
Hopefully
she
hasn
broken
leg
The
other
still
with
shock
Nassun
starts
working
calming
the
horses
coaxing
the
downed
one
back
and
talking
the
other
out
near
catatonia
while
her
father
goes
the
other
travelers
whom
they
can
see
sprawled
around
the
road
The
ones
who
were
within
the
wide
circumference
Nassun
torus
are
okay
The
ones
who
were
not
well
Once
the
horses
are
shaky
but
functional
Nassun
goes
after
Jija
and
finds
him
trying
lift
man
who
has
been
flung
into
tree
broken
the
man
back
conscious
and
cursing
but
Nassun
can
see
the
flop

now
useless
legs
bad
move
him
but
obviously
Jija
thinks
worse
leave
him

She

end
the
world
Jija
darts
glance
back
down
the
road
they
have
walked
but
course
all
they
can
see
are
shattered
trees
and
few
overturned
chunks

along
the

think
Season
The
injured
man
gasps
not
entirely
from
pain
Jija
eyes
wide
and
horrified
But
asks
and
this
important:
cAre
you
sure

Nassun
feels

this
though
she
does
not
really
know
why
cYes
She
bites
her
lip
cIt
going
really
bad
Daddy
Jija
eyes
drift
toward
Tirimo
again
That
conditioned
response:
During
Season
comm
members
know
that
the
only
place
they
can
sure
welcome
there
Anything
else
risk
But
Nassun
will
not
back
now
that
she
away
Not
when
Jija
loves
her
however
strangely
and
has
taken
her
away
and
listening
her
understanding
her
even
though
knows
she
orogene
Mama
was
wrong
about
that
part
She
said
Jija
wouldn
understand
didn
understand
Uche
Nassun
sets
her
teeth
against
this
thought
Uche
was
too
little
Nassun
will
smarter
And
Mama
was
still
only
half
right
Nassun
will
smarter
than
her
too
she
says
softly
cMama
knows
Daddy
Nassun
not
even
sure
what
she
means
this
Knows
that

Knows

Would
Mama
even
believe
that
Jija
could
such
thing
his
own
child
Nassun
can
hardly
believe
herself
But
Jija
flinches
the
words
are
accusation
stares
her
for
long
moment
his
expression
shifting
from
fear
through
horror
through
despair
and
slowly
resignation
looks
down
the
injured
man
one
Nassun
knows
not
from
Tirimo

the
practical
clothes
and
good
shoes

Jija
says
bends
and
snaps
the

drawing
breath
ask
For
what
Then
Jija
rises
His
hands
are
shaking
again
but
turns
and
extends
one
them
Nassun
takes
They
walk
back
the
wagon
then
and
