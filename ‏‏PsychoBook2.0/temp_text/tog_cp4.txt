TIRED
AFTER
CALLING
THE
OBELISK
When
you
get
back
your
room
and
stretch
out
for
half
moment
the
bare
pallet
that
came
with
the
apartment
you
fall
asleep
fast
you
don
even
realize
you
doing
the
dead
the
night
your
body
clock
says
since
the
glowing
walls
haven
changed
your
eyes
blink
open
and
like
only
moment
has
passed
But
Hoa
curled
beside
you
apparently
actually
sleeping
for
once
and
you
can
hear
Tonkee
snoring
faintly
the
room
next
door
and
you
feel
much
better
than
you
did
hungry
Well
rested
for
perhaps
the
first
time
weeks
The
hunger
spurs
you
and
into
the
apartment
living
room
There
small
hempen
satchel
the
table
which
Tonkee
must
acquired
partially
open
reveal
mushrooms
and
small
pile
dried
beans
and
other
cachefood
That
right:
accepted
members
Castrima
you
now
get
share
the
comm
stores
None
the
kind
food
you
can
just
eat
for
snack
except
maybe
the
mushrooms
but
you
never
seen
those
before
and
some
varieties
mushrooms
need
cooked
edible
You
tempted
but
Castrima
the
sort
comm
that
would
give
dangerous
foodstuffs
newcomers
without
warning
them
Hmm
Right
You
fetch
your
runny
sack
rummage
for
the
remaining
provisions
you
brought
Castrima
with
you
and
make
meal
out
dried
oranges
cachebread
crusts
and
lump
bad
tasting
jerky
that
you
traded
for
the
last
comm
you
passed
and
which
you
suspect
hydro
pipe
rat
meat
Food
that
which
nourishes
the
lorists
say
You
just
choked
the
jerky
down
and
are
sitting
there
sleepily
pondering
how
merely
summoning
obelisk
took
much
out
you
anything
regarding
the
obelisks
can
described
with
the
adjective
merely
when
you
become
aware
high
rhythmic
scraping
sound
outside
You
dismiss
immediately
Nothing
about
this
comm
makes
sense
will
probably
take
you
weeks
not
months
get
used
its
peculiar
sounds
(Months
Are
you
giving
Nassun
easily
you
ignore
the
sound
even
grows
louder
and
closer
and
you
keep
yawning
and
you
about
get
and
head
back
bed
when
belatedly
dawns
you
that
what
you
hearing
screaming
Frowning
you
the
door
the
apartment
pulling
open
the
thin
curtain
You
not
particularly
concerned
your
sessapinae
haven
even
twitched
and
anyway
there
ever
shake
down
here
Castrima
under
everyone
dead
matter
how
quickly
they
leave
their
homes
Outside
there
are
lots
people
and
about
woman
passes
right
your
door
carrying
big
basket
the
same
mushrooms
you
almost
ate
she
nods
you
distractedly
you
come
out
then
almost
loses
her
load
she
tries
turn
toward
the
noise
and
nearly
bumps
into
man
pushing
covered
wheeled
bin
that
stinks
the
sky
and
probably
from
the
latrines
comm
with
functional
day
night
cycle
Castrima
effectively
never
sleeps
and
you
know
they
have
six
work
shifts
instead
the
usual
three
because
you
been
put
one
won
start
till
midday
twelvebell
the
Castrima
folk
say
when
you
supposed
look
for
some
woman
named
Artith
near
the
forge
And
none
this
relevant
because
through
the
scatter
and
jut
Castrima
crystals
you
can
see
small
cluster
people
coming
into
the
big
rectangular
tunnel
mouth
that
serves
the
entrance
the
geode
They
running
and
they
carrying
another
person
who
doing
all
the
screaming
Even
then
you
tempted
ignore
and
back
sleep
Season
People
die
there
nothing
you
can
about
These
aren
even
your
people
There
reason
for
you
care
Then
someone
shouts
Lerna
And
the
tone
panicked
that
you
twitch
You
can
see
the
squat
gray
crystal
that
houses
Lerna
apartment
from
your
balcony
three
crystals
away
and
little
below
your
own
His
door
curtain
jerks
open
and
hurries
out
shrugging
shirt
runs
down
the
nearest
set
steps
Heading
for
the
infirmary
where
the
cluster
running
folk
seems
going
well
For
reasons
that
you
cannot
name
you
glance
back
your
own
apartment
doorway
Tonkee
who
sleeps
like
petrified
wood
hasn
come
out
but
Hoa
there
statue
still
and
watching
you
Something
about
his
expression
makes
you
frown
doesn
seem
able
the
emotionless
stoneface
his
kin
maybe
because
doesn
have
face
actual
stone
Regardless
the
first
thing
you
interpret
his
expression
pity
You
out
the
apartment
and
running
for
the
ground
level
the
next
breath
almost
before
you
thought
about
(You
think
you
run:
The
pity
disguised
stone
eater
has
galvanized
you
the
screams
fellow
human
being
haven
Such
monster
you
are
Castrima
frustratingly
confusing
always
but
this
time
you
aided
the
fact
that
other
people
have
started
running
along
the
bridges
and
walkways
the
direction
the
trouble
you
can
just
with
the
flow
the
time
you
get
there
small
crowd
has
formed
around
the
infirmary
most
the
people
milling
about
curiosity
concern
anxiety
Lerna
and
the
cluster
people
carrying
their
injured
companion
have
gone
inside
and
the
awful
screech
obvious
now
for
what
is:
the
throat
tearing
howl
someone
appalling
pain
pain
beyond
bearing
who
nevertheless
somehow
forced
bear
not
intentional
thing
that
you
start
pushing
forward
get
inside
You
know
nothing
about
giving
medical
care
but
you
know
pain
your
surprise
though
people
glance
you
annoyance
then
blink
and
shift
aside
You
notice
those
who
look
blank
being
pulled
aside
for
quick
whispers
those
whose
eyes
have
widened
Castrima
been
talking
about
you
Then
you
inside
the
infirmary
and
you
nearly
get
knocked
down
Sanzed
woman
running
past
with
some
sort
syringe
her
hands
Can
safe
that
You
follow
her
over
infirmary
bed
where
six
people
hold
down
the
person
doing
the
screaming
You
get
look
the
person
face
when
one
them
shifts
aside:
one
you
know
Just
another
Midlatter
man
who
has
clearly
been
topside
judge
the
gray
layer
ash
his
skin
and
clothing
and
hair
The
woman
with
the
syringe
shoulders
aside
someone
else
and
ostensibly
administers
the
syringe
contents
moment
later
the
man
shudders
all
over
and
his
mouth
begins
close
His
scream
dies
off
slowly
slowly
Slowly
jerks
once
mightily
his
holders
all
shift
with
the
strength
his
effort
Then
last
mercifully
subsides
into
unconsciousness
The
silence
almost
reverberates
Lerna
and
the
Sanzed
healer
keep
moving
though
the
people
who
have
been
holding
the
man
down
draw
back
and
look
each
other
asking
what
now
the
now
silent
confusion
you
cannot
help
glancing
off
toward
the
far
end
the
infirmary
where
Alabaster
still
sits
unnoticed
the
infirmary
new
guests
His
stone
eater
stands
where
you
last
saw
her
though
her
gaze
also
fixed
the
tableau
You
can
see
Alabaster
face
over
the
beds
his
eyes
slide
over
meet
yours
but
then
they
shift
away
Your
attention
recaptured
the
man
the
bed
some
the
people
around
him
step
back
first
you
can
tell
what
the
problem
other
than
that
his
pants
seem
oddly
wet
patches
caked
with
muddy
ash
The
wetness
isn
red
not
blood
but
there
smell
that
you
not
sure
how
describe
Meat
brine
Hot
fat
His
boots
are
off
baring
feet
which
still
spasmodically
twitch
little
the
splayed
toes
relaxing
only
reluctantly
even
unconsciousness
Lerna
cutting
open
one
pants
leg
with
pair
scissors
What
you
notice
first
peels
away
the
damp
cloth
are
the
small
round
blue
hemispheres
that
dot
the
man
skin
here
and
there
each
perhaps
two
inches
diameter
and
inch
rounded
height
shiny
and
foreign
his
flesh
There
are
ten
fifteen
them
Each
sits
the
center
patch
bloated
pink
brown
flesh
covering
perhaps
handspan
the
man
legs
You
think
the
lumps
are
jewels
first
That
kind
what
they
look
like
metallic
over
the
blue
and
beautiful
cFuck
says
someone
voice
soft
with
shock
and
someone
else
says
cWhat
the
rust
Someone
else
pushes
into
the
infirmary
behind
you
after
moment
argument
with
the
people
who
blocked
off
the
door
She
comes
stand
beside
you
and
you
look
over
Ykka
whose
eyes
widen
confusion
and
revulsion
for
instant
before
she
schools
her
expression
blankness
Then
she
says
sharply
enough
jerk
people
out
staring
cWhat
happened
(You
notice
belatedly
perhaps
right
time
that
another
stone
eater

room
not
far
beyond
the
tableau
She

the
red
haired
one
who
greeted
you
along
with
Ykka
when
you
first
came
Castrima
She
watching
Ykka
now
avidly
but
her
stone
gaze
occasionally
drifts
toward
you
too
You
suddenly
become
hyperaware
that
Hoa
did
not
follow
you
from
the
apartment
cOuter

another
ash
covered
Midlatter
man
Ykka
doesn
look
like
Strongback
too
small
Maybe
one
the
new
Hunters
comes
around
the
bedside
group
and
fixes
his
gaze
Ykka
she
all
that
prevents
him
from
staring
the
injured
man
until
his
mind
breaks
cWe
were
out
the

There
was

just

Lerna

another
man
who
twitches
and

You

before
cSome

the
Sanzed
woman
who
injected
the
man
She
sounds
disbelieving
she
speaking
Lerna
trying
convince
him
rather
than
herself

grimly

The

was
just

was

Like

here
Ykka
lips
press
together
but
she
rolls
her
sleeves
and
goes
over
pushing
through
the
other
shocked
people
nearby
She
yells
cBack

don

out
the

Some
the
milling
people
start
pulling
others
away
Someone
else
grabs
for
one
the
jewel
objects
and
tries
pull
off
then
jerks
their

away

Lerna
did
The
object
changes
two
pieces
the
shiny
blue
surface
flaking
away
and
lifting
before
clapping
back
into
place
and
suddenly
shifts
your
head
not
jewel
bug
Some
kind
beetle
and
the
iridescent
shell
its
carapace
the
moment
that
lifted
its
wing
covers
you
saw
that
its
round
body
was
translucent
with
something
jumping
and
bubbling
inside
You
can
sess
the
heat
even
from
where
you
are

The

steams
around
Someone
gives
Lerna
the

and
tries

off
Its

skeets
across

drops

someone
says
Someone
else
grabs
his

and
tries
quickly

off

stuff
but
you
know
what
even
before
Lerna
gasps
cNo
Just

Scalding

cCareful
says
the
other
Hunter
belatedly
One
his

bears

blisters
you
notice
You
also
notice
that
doesn
look
back
the
infirmary
table
any
the
people
there
This
too
horrible
watch
The
rusting
bugs
are
boiling
the
man
death
But
when
you
look
away
you
see
that
Alabaster
watching
you
again
Alabaster
who
himself
covered
burns
but
who
should
dead
one
stands
near
the
epicenter
continent
spanning
fissure
vent
and
gets
only
patchy
third
degree
burns
should
been
ashes
scattered
over
Yumenes
melted
streets
You
realize
this
gazes
you
though
his
expression
indifferent
another
man
trial
fire
familiar
sort
indifference
Fulcrum
familiar
the
indifference
that
comes
too
many
betrayals
too
many
friends
lost
for
good
reason
too
many
ctoo
horrible
watch
atrocities
seen
And
yet
The
reverberation
Alabaster
orogeny
carelessly
powerful
diamond
precise
and
achingly
familiar
that
you
have
close
your
eyes
and
fight
off
memories
heaving
ship
deck
lonely
highroad
windy
rock
island
The
torus
that
spins
devastatingly
small
barely
inch
wide
attenuated
that
you
cannot
find
its
hairpin
fulcrum
still
better
than
you
Then
you
hear
gasp
You
open
your
eyes
see
one
the
bugs
shiver
hiss
like
living
teakettle
and
then
freeze
over
Its
legs
which
had
been
hooked
into
the
boiled
flesh
around
pop
loose
dead
But
then
you
hear
soft
groan
and
the
orogeny
dissipates
You
look
over
see
that
Alabaster
has
bowed
his
head
and
hunched
over
His
stone
eater
slow
grind
crouches
beside
him
something
her
posture
indicating
concern
even
her
face
placid
ever
The
red
haired
stone
eater
internal
exasperation
you
decide
call
her
Ruby
Hair
for
now
gazing
him
too
That
then
You
look
back
the
man
and
your
gaze
catches
Lerna
who
looking
the
frozen
bug
fascination
His
eyes
lift
sweep
the
room
stutter
across
yours
stop
You
see
the
question
there
and
start
shake
your
head:
you
did
not
freeze
the
bug
But
that
isn
the
right
question
and
maybe
isn
even
the
question
asking
doesn
need

you
did

Ykka
stone

takes
slow
step
closer
You
sess
her
movement
rather
than

like

Then
Ruby
Hair
stops
suddenly
there
another
mountain
its
way:
Hoa
stock
still
and
quietly
cold
Where
did

from
You
cannot
spare
another
thought
for
these
creatures
right
now
You
begin
slowly
using
your
eyes
well
your
sessapinae
determine
exactly
where
stop
but
Alabaster
has
shown
you
the
way
You

one
one

some
them
crack
open
with

and
one

even
pops
off
flying
off
toward
the
side
the

(People
move
out

even
faster
than
they

Then

Everyone
stares

You

She
blinks

All
once
you
hear
people
exclaim
outside
and
you
glance
through
the
infirmary

The
infirmary
built

not

from

the
giant

inside

Outside
however
through
the
uncurtained

you
can
see
the

glowing
noticeably
brighter
all
over

You
stare
Ykka
She
nods
back

should
have
any

she

Then
Ykka
steps
over
grab
another
pair
forceps
help
Lerna
pulling
one
the
beetles
again
despite
his
scalded
fingers
and
this
time
the
thing
coming
off
proboscis
long
its
body
slides
out
the
boiled
flesh
and
you
can
look
anymore

makes

outside

and
then
you
sit
down
the
low
flattened
tip
crystal
that
only
just
beginning
grow
out
the
geode
wall
one
bothers
you
though
you
feel
the
pressure
gazes
and
hear
the
echo
whispers
You
don
mean
stay
long
but
you
You
don
know
why
Eventually
shadow
falls
over
your
feet
You
look
see
Lerna
standing
there
Beyond
him
Ykka
walking
away
with
another
man
who
trying
talk
her
she
seems
angrily
ignoring
him
The
rest
the
crowd
has
dispersed
last
though
you
can
see
through
the
open
doorway
that
there
still
more
people
the
infirmary
than
usual
perhaps
visiting
the
poor
half
cooked
Hunter
Lerna
isn
looking
you
staring
the
far
wall
the
geode
which
lost
the
hazy
glow
from
dozens
crystals
between
here
and
there
also
smoking

The

you

Then
you
understand
The

burned
through

even
down

With

and
cutting

maybe
the

heal
and
even
then
might
never

again
With
just
whatever
equipment
and
medicines
Castrima
has

the
best
Lerna
can
amputate
The
man
might
survive
But
this
Season

every

must
earn
their
shelter
from

very

You
decide

the

slightly
never

anything
like
those

The

with

You

Yes
Cooked

probably
lasts
longer
cYou
could

the
instant

Lerna
adds
You
blink
Then
registers
your
mind
that
this
statement
was
attack
mildly
delivered
from
such
unexpected
quarter
that
you
too
surprised
angry
couldn
you
say
cAt

Lerna
pivots
face
you
and
all
sudden
you
realize
that
his
placid
manner
has
been
concealing
absolute
rage
His
gaze
cool
but
visible
everything
else:
his
white
lips
the
flex
muscle
his
jaw
his
flaring
nostrils
cWhy

saying

might
have

and
kill

You
open
your

takes
step
toward
you
though
and
aggressive
that
you
actually
sit
cTell

die
again
and
again
and
again
until
get

cuts
himself
off
with
choked
sound
turning
away
sharply
You
stare
his
tense
back
and
say
nothing
because
there
nothing
you
can
say
This
the
second
time
mentioned
your
murder
Tirimo
And
that
surprising
was
born
there
grew
there
Lerna
mother
was
still
living
there
when
you
left
You
think
Maybe
you
killed
her
too
that
last
day
There
nothing
you
can
say
not
with
guilt
souring
your
mouth
but
you
try
anyway
sorry
laughs
doesn
even
sound
like
him
ugly
and
angry
Then
resumes
his
former
posture
gazing
the
far
geode

control
himself
now
the

his

isn
jumping
quite
much

need
retwist
your

cFather

just
question
how
long
will
take
cHow
long

flat

suspects
the

already
And
deserves

cTen

Not
long

the
real

lies
what
the

might
set
off
Enough
ash
covering
the
warm
surface
the
sea
and
the
ice
might
grow

That
means
saltier

Drier

And
the
most

should
that
happen
the
Equatorials

winter
that
really
kills
during
Seasons
Starvation
Exposure
Even
after
the

though
the
Rift
could
cause
age
winter
that
lasts
millions
years
None
which
matters
because

will
have
gone
extinct
