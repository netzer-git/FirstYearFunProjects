WHAT
YOU
SAY
moon
Alabaster
beloved
monster
sane
madman
the
most
powerful
orogene
all
the
Stillness
and
progress
stone
eater
snack
stares
you
This
has
all
its
old
intensity
and
you
feel
the
will
him
the
stuff
that
makes
him
the
force
nature
that
almost
physical
rider
that
stare
The
Guardians
were
fools
ever
consider
him
tame
satellite
what
makes
little
sound
frustration
completely
the
same
aside
from
being
partially
turned
stone
the
days
when
you
and
were
less
than
lovers
and
more
than
friends
Ten
years
and
another
self
ago
cAstronomestry
isn
foolishness
says
know
you
were
taught
that
everyone
the
Stillness
thinks
waste
energy
study
the
sky
when
the
ground
that
trying
kill
but
Earthfires
Syen
thought
you
would
learned
question
the
status
quo
little
better
now
had
other
things
you
snap
just
like
you
always
used
snap
him
But
thinking
the
old
days
makes
you
think
what
you
been
the
meantime
And
that
makes
you
think
your
living
daughter
and
your
dead
son
and
your
soon
very
husband
and
you
flinch
physically
cAnd
name
Essun
now
told
you
cWhatever
With
groaning
sigh
Alabaster
carefully
sits
back
against
the
wall
cThey
say
you
came
here
with
geomest
Have
her
explain
you
don
have
lot
energy
these
days
Because
being
eaten
probably
takes
toll
cYou
didn
answer
first
question
Can
you
yet
Can
you
call
the
obelisks
you
question
that
made
sense
when
first
asked
possibly
because
you
were
distracted
realizing
was
alive
turning
stone
and
the
orogene
responsible
for
ripping
the
continent
half
and
touching
off
Season
that
may
never
end
cThe
obelisks
You
shake
your
head
more
confused
than
refusing
Your
gaze
drifts
the
strange
object
near
his
bed
which
looks
like
excessively
long
pink
glassknife
and
feels
like
obelisk
even
though
cannot
possibly
cWhat
don
know
haven
tried
since
Meov
groans
softly
shutting
his
eyes
cYou
rusting
useless
Syen
Essun
Never
had
any
respect
for
the
craft
respect
fine
just
don
cJust
enough
get
enough
excel
but
only
for
gain
They
told
you
how
high
and
you
jumped
further
all
get
nicer
apartment
and
another
ring
cFor
privacy
you
ass
and
some
control
over
life
and
some
rusting
respect
cAnd
you
actually
listened
that
Guardian
yours
when
you
don
listen
anybody
else
Hey
Ten
years
schoolteacher
have
given
your
voice
obsidian
edge
Alabaster
actually
stops
ranting
and
blinks
you
Very
quietly
you
say
cYou
know
full
well
why
listened
him
There
moment
silence
Both
you
take
this
time
regroup
cYou
right
says
length
sorry
Because
every
Imperial
Orogene
listens
listened
their
assigned
Guardian
Those
who
didn
died
ended
node
Except
again
for
Alabaster
you
never
did
find
out
what
did
his
Guardian
You
offer
stiff
nod
truce
cApology
accepted
takes
careful
breath
looking
weary
cTry
Essun
Try
reach
obelisk
Today
need
know
cWhy
What
this
about
still
light
What
does
Satellite
And
all
irrelevant
you
can
control
the
obelisks
His
eyes
are
actually
drifting
shut
This
probably
good
thing
need
his
strength
survive
whatever
happening
him
survivable
cWorse
than
irrelevant
You
remember
why
wouldn
tell
you
about
the
obelisks
the
first
place
don
you
Yes
Once
before
you
ever
paid
attention
those
great
floating
half
real
crystals
the
sky
you
asked
Alabaster
explain
how
accomplished
some
his
amazing
feats
orogeny
wouldn
tell
you
and
you
hated
him
for
that
but
now
you
know
just
how
dangerous
the
knowledge
was
you
hadn
understood
that
the
obelisks
were
amplifiers
orogeny
amplifiers
you
would
never
have
reached
for
the
garnet
save
yourself
from
Guardian
attack
But
the
garnet
obelisk
hadn
been
half
dead
itself
cracked
and
stuffed
with
frozen
stone
eater
would
have
killed
you
You
didn
have
the
strength
the
self
control
prevent
the
power
from
frying
you
from
the
brain
down
And
now
Alabaster
wants
you
reach
for
one
deliberately
see
what
happens
Alabaster
knows
your
face
cGo
and
see
says
His
eyes
shut
completely
then
You
hear
faint
rattle
his
breath
like
gravel
his
lungs
cThe
topaz
floating
somewhere
nearby
Call
tonight
then
the
morning
see
Abruptly
seems
weaken
running
out
strength
cSee
come
hasn
tell
and
find
someone
else
what
can
myself
Find
who
what
you
can
even
begin
guess
cWill
you
still
tell
what
all
this
about
cNo
Because
spite
everything
Essun
don
want
you
die
takes
deep
breath
lets
out
slowly
The
next
words
are
softer
than
usual
cIt
good
see
you
You
have
tighten
your
jaw
reply
cYeah
says
nothing
more
and
that
enough
goodbye
for
both
you
You
get
glancing
the
stone
eater
who
stands
nearby
Alabaster
calls
her
Antimony
She
stands
statue
still
the
way
they
her
too
black
eyes
watching
you
too
steadily
and
though
her
pose
something
classical
you
think
there
hint
irony
She
stands
with
head
elegantly
tilted
one
hand
her
hip
and
the
other
upraised
and
poised
with
the
fingers
relaxed
waving
particular
direction
Maybe
come
hither
maybe
backhanded
farewell
maybe
that
thing
people
when
they
keeping
secret
and
want
you
know
but
they
don
want
tell
you
what
cTake
care
him
you
say
her
cAs
would
any
precious
thing
she
replies
without
moving
her
mouth
You
not
even
going
start
trying
interpret
that
You
head
back
toward
the
infirmary
entrance
where
Hoa
stands
waiting
for
you
Hoa
who
looks
like
utterly
strange
human
boy
who
actually
stone
eater
somehow
and
who
treats
you
his
precious
thing
watches
you
unhappily
has
done
since
you
realized
what
was
You
shake
your
head
and
move
past
him
your
way
out
follows
pace
early
night
the
comm
Castrima
Hard
tell
since
the
giant
geode
soft
white
light
emitted
impossibly
from
the
massive
crystals
that
make
its
substance
never
changes
People
are
bustling
about
carrying
things
shouting
each
other
going
about
their
usual
business
without
the
necessary
slowdown
that
would
occur
other
comms
with
the
reduction
light
Sleeping
will
difficult
for
few
days
you
suspect
least
until
you
get
used
this
That
doesn
matter
Obelisks
don
care
about
the
time
day
Lerna
been
politely
waiting
outside
while
you
and
Hoa
met
with
Alabaster
and
Antimony
falls
you
come
out
his
expression
expectant
need
the
surface
you
say
Lerna
makes
face
cThe
guards
won
let
you
Essun
People
new
the
comm
aren
trusted
Castrima
survival
depends
remaining
secret
Seeing
Alabaster
again
has
brought
back
lot
the
old
memories
and
the
old
orneriness
cThey
can
try
stop
Lerna
stops
walking
cAnd
then
you
what
you
did
Tirimo
Rusting
hell
You
stop
too
rocking
little
from
the
force
that
blow
Hoa
stops
well
eying
Lerna
thoughtfully
Lerna
not
glaring
The
look
his
face
too
flat
glare
Damn
Okay
After
moment
Lerna
sighs
and
comes
over
cWe
Ykka
says
cWe
tell
her
what
need
ask
topside
with
guards
she
wants
All
right
reasonable
that
you
don
know
why
you
didn
even
consider
Well
you
know
why
Ykka
might
orogene
like
you
but
you
spent
too
many
years
being
thwarted
and
betrayed
other
orogenes
the
Fulcrum
you
know
better
than
trust
her
just
because
she
Your
People
You
should
give
her
chance
because
she
Your
People
though
cFine
you
say
and
follow
him
Ykka
Ykka
place
larger
than
yours
and
not
distinct
any
way
despite
being
the
home
the
comm
headwoman
Just
another
apartment
carved
means
unknown
into
the
side
giant
glowing
white
crystal
Two
people
wait
outside
its
door
however
one
leaning
against
the
crystal
and
another
peering
over
the
railing
the
expanse
Castrima
Lerna
takes
position
behind
them
and
directs
you
the
same
Only
fair
wait
your
turn
and
the
obelisks
aren
going
anywhere
The
woman
gazing
out
the
view
glances
over
and
looks
you
and
down
She
little
older
Sanzed
though
darker
complected
than
most
and
her
bushel
hair
ashblow
with
slight
kink
making
frizzy
cloud
instead
just
coarse
one
Got
some
Eastcoaster
her
And
Westcoaster
too:
Her
gaze
through
epicanthic
folded
eyes
and
assessing
wary
and
unimpressed
cYou
the
new
one
she
says
Not
question
You
nod
back
cEssun
She
grins
lopsidedly
and
you
blink
Her
teeth
have
been
filed
points
even
though
Sanzeds
supposedly
stopped
doing
that
centuries
ago
Bad
for
their
reputation
after
the
Season
Teeth
cHjarka
Leadership
Castrima
Welcome
our
little
hole
the
ground
Her
smile
widens
You
stifle
grimace
the
pun
though
you
thinking
too
after
hearing
her
name
usually
bad
news
when
comm
has
Leadership
caste
that
isn
charge
Dissatisfied
Leaders
have
nasty
habit
fomenting
coups
during
crises
But
this
Ykka
problem
deal
with
not
yours
The
other
person
waiting
the
man
leaning
the
crystal
doesn
seem
watching
you
but
you
notice
how
his
eyes
aren
moving
track
whatever
looking
off
the
distance
thin
shorter
than
you
with
hair
and
beard
that
make
you
think
strawberries
growing
amid
hay
You
imagine
the
delicate
pressure
his
indirect
attention
You
not
imagine
the
ping
instinct
that
tells
you
another
your
kind
Since
doesn
acknowledge
your
presence
you
say
nothing
him
cHe
came
few
months
ago
Lerna
says
distracting
you
from
your
new
neighbors
For
moment
you
wonder
means
the
strawberry
hay
haired
man
and
then
you
realize
referring
Alabaster
cJust
appeared
the
middle
what
passes
for
town
square
within
the
geode
Flat
Top
nods
toward
something
beyond
you
and
you
turn
trying
understand
what
means
Ah:
there
amid
the
many
sharp
tipped
crystals
Castrima
one
that
looks
been
sheared
off
halfway
leaving
wide
hexagonal
platform
positioned
and
elevated
near
the
center
the
comm
Several
stair
bridges
connect
and
there
are
chairs
and
railing
Flat
Top
Lerna
goes
cThere
was
warning
Apparently
the
orogenes
didn
sess
anything
and
the
stills
guard
duty
didn
see
anything
and
that
stone
eater
his
were
suddenly
just
there
doesn
see
you
frown
surprise
You
never
heard
still
use
the
word
still
before
cMaybe
the
stone
eaters
knew
was
coming
but
they
rarely
talk
anyone
but
their
chosen
people
And
this
case
they
didn
even
that
Lerna
gaze
drifts
over
Hoa
who
studiously
ignoring
him
that
very
moment
Lerna
shakes
his
head
cYkka
tried
throw
him
out
course
though
she
offered
him
mercy
killing
wanted
His
prognosis
obvious
gentle
drugs
and
bed
would
kindness
did
something
when
she
called
the
Strongbacks
though
The
light
went
out
The
air
and
water
stopped
Only
for
minute
but
felt
like
year
When
let
everything
come
back
everyone
was
upset
Ykka
said
could
stay
and
that
should
treat
his
injuries
Sounds
about
right
cHe
ten
ringer
you
say
cAnd
ass
Give
him
whatever
wants
and
nice
about
cHe
from
the
Fulcrum
Lerna
inhales
what
seems
awe
cEarthfires
had
idea
any
Imperial
Orogenes
had
survived
You
look
him
too
surprised
for
amusement
But
then
how
would
know
Another
thought
sobers
you
cHe
turning
stone
you
say
softly
cYes
Lerna
says
ruefully
never
seen
anything
like
And
getting
worse
The
first
day
was
here
was
just
his
fingers
that
had
that
the
stone
eater
had
taken
haven
seen
how
the
condition
progresses
careful
only
when
assistants
aren
around
don
know
she
doing
him
somehow
doing
himself
shakes
his
head
cWhen
ask
about
just
grins
and
says
Just
bit
longer
please
waiting
for
someone
Lerna
frowns
you
thoughtful
And
there
that:
Somehow
Alabaster
knew
you
were
coming
maybe
didn
Maybe
was
hoping
for
someone
anyone
with
the
necessary
skill
Good
chance
here
with
Ykka
somehow
summoning
every
rogga
for
miles
You
only
what
was
waiting
for
turns
out
you
can
summon
obelisk
After
few
moments
Ykka
pokes
her
head
out
the
apartment
through
the
hanging
She
nods
Hjarka
glares
Strawberry
Hay
until
sighs
and
turns
face
her
then
spies
you
and
Lerna
and
Hoa
cOh
Hey
Good
All
you
come
You
start
protest
need
talk
you
private
She
stares
back
you
You
blink
confused
thrown
annoyed
She
keeps
staring
Lerna
shifts
from
foot
foot
beside
you
silent
pressure
Hoa
merely
watches
following
your
lead
Finally
you
get
the
message:
her
comm
her
rules
and
you
want
live
here
You
sigh
and
file
behind
the
others
Inside
the
apartment
warmer
than
most
the
comm
and
darker
the
curtain
makes
difference
even
though
the
walls
glow
Makes
feel
like
night
which
probably
topside
good
idea
steal
for
your
own
place
you
think
before
checking
yourself
because
you
shouldn
thinking
long
term
And
then
you
check
yourself
again
because
you
lost
Nassun
and
Jija
trail
you
should
think
long
term
And
then
cRight
says
Ykka
sounding
bored
she
moves
sit
simple
low
divan
cross
legged
with
her
chin
propped
fist
The
others
sit
well
but
she
looking
you
been
thinking
about
some
changes
already
You
two
arrived
convenient
time
For
moment
you
think
she
including
Lerna
that
cyou
two
but
sits
down
the
divan
nearest
hers
and
there
something
some
ease
movement
comfort
his
manner
that
tells
you
heard
this
before
She
means
Hoa
then
Hoa
takes
the
floor
which
makes
him
seem
more
like
child
though
isn
strange
how
hard
for
you
remember
that
You
sit
down
gingerly
cConvenient
for
what
still
don
think
this
good
idea
Strawberry
Hay
says
looking
you
though
his
face
tilted
toward
Ykka
cWe
don
know
anything
about
these
people
Yeek
cWe
know
they
survived
out
there
until
yesterday
says
Hjarka
leaning
the
side
and
propping
her
elbow
the
divan
arm
cThat
something
cThat
nothing
Strawberry
Hay
you
really
want
know
his
name
sets
his
jaw
cOur
Hunters
can
survive
out
there
Hunters
You
blink
That
one
the
old
use
castes
deprecated
one
per
Imperial
Law
nobody
gets
born
into
anymore
Civilized
societies
don
need
hunter
gatherers
That
Castrima
feels
the
need
says
more
about
the
state
the
comm
than
anything
else
Ykka
has
told
you
cOur
Hunters
know
the
terrain
and
our
Strongbacks
too
yeah
Hjarka
says
Nearby
Newcomers
know
more
about
the
conditions
beyond
our
territory
the
people
the
hazards
everything
else
not
sure
know
anything
useful
you
begin
But
even
you
say
this
you
frown
because
you
remembering
that
thing
you
started
noticing
few
roadhouses
ago
The
sashes
rags
fine
silk
too
many
the
Equatorials
wrists
The
closed
looks
they
gave
you
their
focus
while
others
sat
shell
shocked
every
encampment
you
saw
them
look
their
fellow
survivors
over
picking
out
any
Sanzeds
who
were
better
equipped
healthier
otherwise
doing
better
than
average
Speaking
those
chosen
people
quiet
voices
Leaving
the
next
morning
groups
larger
than
those
which
they
had
arrived
Does
that
mean
anything
Like
keeping
like
the
old
way
but
races
and
nations
haven
been
important
for
long
time
Communities
purpose
and
diverse
specialization
are
more
efficient
Old
Sanze
proved
Yet
Yumenes
slag
the
bottom
fissure
vent
now
and
the
laws
and
ways
the
Empire
longer
have
any
bite
Maybe
this
the
first
sign
change
then
Maybe
few
years
you
have
leave
Castrima
and
find
comm
full
Midlatters
like
you
who
are
brown
but
not
too
brown
big
but
not
too
big
with
hair
that
curly
kinky
but
never
ashblow
straight
Nassun
can
come
with
you
that
case
But
how
long
would
the

able
hide
what
you
are

except
this
one
cYou
know
more

Ykka
says
interrupting
your
woolgathering
cAnd
anyway
don
have
the
patience

about
telling
you
what

weeks
back
She

You

You
more
than

about

cThat

his

Ykka
nods
toward
Strawberry
Hay
and
Hjarka
cAnyway
you
learn
Your
mouth
hangs
open
Then
occurs
you
that
she
did
include
Hoa
this

she
cEarthfires

you

cWhy
not
They

More
them

She
focuses
Hoa

quietly
Then:

down

hard

Her
expression
something
between
hostile
and
guarded
cYou

she
says
Her

flick
toward
you
cAnd

Don
you
You

Ykka
stone
eater
the
woman
with
the
ruby
hair
for
few
hours
That
doesn

she
isn

You

Antimony
Hoa

Ykka
You

She
smiles
thinly
cMakes

You
have

You

fleetingly
that
Ykka
should

But
that
could

awkward

Hjarka

Hay
you

Hjarka
cYes

Ykka

cCutter

Ykka
says
She
leaning
against
the
wall
behind
the
divan
now
rubbing
her
eyes
she
tired
cPeople
guessed
anyway
The
rumors
were
enough
keep
him
from

half
dozen
times
over

cIf

Cutter
replies
still
smiling
that
paper
thin
way
Ykka
lowers
her
hand
Her
jaw
tight
cDenying
what
you
are
didn
keep
people
from
knowing
what
you

cAnd
flaunting
isn
what
saved
you
Ykka
takes
deep
breath
The
muscles
her

flex
relax
cAnd
that
would
why
asked
you
this
Cutter
But
let
move
goes
You
sit
there
throughout
the
meeting
trying
understand
the
undercurrents
you
picking
still
not
believing
you
even
here
while
Ykka
lays
out
all
the
problems
facing
Castrima
stuff
you
never
had
think
about
before:
Complaints
that
the
hot
water
the
communal
pools
isn
hot
enough
serious
shortage
potters
but
overabundance
people
who
know
how
sew
Fungus
one
the
granary
caverns
several
months
supply
had
burned
lest
contaminate
the
rest
meat
shortage
You
gone
from
thinking
obsessively
about
one
person
having
concerned
with
many
bit
sudden
just
took
bath
you
blurt
trying
pull
yourself
out
daze
cThe
water
was
nice
cOf
course
you
thought
was
nice
You
been
living
rough
for
months
bathing
cold
streams
you
even
bothered
lot
the
people
Castrima
have
never
lived
without
reliable
geo
and
adjustable
faucets
Ykka
rubs
her
eyes
The
meeting
only
been
hour
but
feels
longer
cEverybody
copes
with
Season
their
own
way
Complaining
about
nothing
doesn
seem
like
coping
you
but
okay
cBeing
low
meat
actual
problem
Lerna
says
frowning
noticed
the
last
few
comm
shares
didn
have
any
eggs
Ykka
expression
grows
grimmer
cYes
That
why
For
your
sake
she
adds
cWe
don
have
greenland
this
comm
you
haven
noticed
yet
The
soil
around
here
poor
all
right
for
gardening
but
not
for
grass
hay
Then
for
the
last
few
years
before
the
Season
started
everyone
was
busy
arguing
about
whether
should
rebuild
the
old
pre
Choking
wall
that
nobody
thought
contract
with
agricultural
comm
for
few
dozen
cartloads
good
soil
She
sighs
rubbing
the
bridge
her
nose
cCan
bring
most
livestock
down
the
mine
shafts
and
stairs
anyway
don
know
what
were
thinking
trying
live
down
here
This
exactly
why
need
help
Her
weariness
isn
surprise
but
her
willingness
admit
error
also
troubling
You
say:
comm
can
only
have
one
leader
during
Season
cYeah
and
that
still
Don
you
forget
could
warn
off
but
doesn
sound
like
one
You
suspect
just
matter
fact
acceptance
her
place
Castrima:
The
people
chose
her
and
for
the
time
being
they
trust
her
They
don
know
you
Lerna
Hoa
and
apparently
they
don
trust
Hjarka
and
Cutter
You
need
her
more
than
she
needs
any
you
Abruptly
though
Ykka
shakes
her
head
can
talk
about
this
shit
anymore
Good
because
the
looming
sense
disjunct
this
morning
you
were
thinking
the
road
and
survival
and
Nassun
beginning
feel
overwhelming
need
topside
too
abrupt
change
subject
apparently
out
the
blue
and
for
moment
they
all
stare
you
cThe
rust
for
Ykka
asks
cAlabaster
Ykka
looks
blank
cThe
ten
ringer
your
infirmary
asked
something
Ykka
grimaces
cOh
Him
You
can
help
smiling
this
reaction
cInteresting
hasn
talked
anyone
since
got
here
Just
sits
there
using
our
antibiotics
and
eating
our
food
just
made
batch
cillin
Ykka
Lerna
rolls
his
eyes
cIt
the
principle
the
thing
You
suspect
Alabaster
been
quelling
the
local
microshakes
and
any
aftershakes
from
the
north
which
would
more
than
earn
his
keep
But
Ykka
can
sess
that
for
herself
explaining
pointless
and
you
not
sure
you
can
trust
her
enough
talk
about
Alabaster
yet
cHe
old
friend
There
That
good
incomplete
summary
cHe
didn
seem
the
type
have
friends
You
either
She
regards
you
for
long
moment
cAre
you
ten
ringer
too
Your
fingers
flex
involuntarily
wore
six
rings
once
Lerna
head
snaps
around
and
stares
you
Well
Cutter
face
twitches
way
you
can
interpret
You
add:
cAlabaster
was
mentor
back
when
was
still
with
the
Fulcrum
see
And
what
does
want
you
topside
You
open
your
mouth
then
close
You
can
help
glancing
Hjarka
who
snorts
and
gets
her
feet
and
Lerna
whose
expression
tightens
realizes
you
don
want
speak
front
him
deserves
better
than
that
but
still
still
Finally
you
say
cOrogene
business
weak
Lerna
face
goes
blank
but
his
eyes
are
hard
Hjarka
waves
and
heads
for
the
curtain
cThen
out
Come
Cutter
Since
you
just
Strongback
She
barks
out
laugh
Cutter
stiffens
but
your
surprise
rises
and
follows
her
out
You
eye
Lerna
for
moment
but
folds
his
arms
Not
going
anywhere
All
right
the
wake
this
Ykka
looks
skeptical
cWhat
this
final
lesson
from
your
old
mentor
obviously
not
going
live
much
longer
Your
jaw
tightens
before
you
can
help
cThat
remains
seen
Ykka
looks
thoughtful
for
moment
longer
and
then
she
nods
decisively
getting
her
feet
cAll
right
then
Just
let
get
some
Strongbacks
together
and
our
way
cWait
you
coming
Why
cCuriosity
want
see
what
Fulcrum
six
ringer
can
She
grins
you
and
picks
the
long
fur
vest
you
first
saw
her
wearing
cMaybe
see
can
too
You
flinch
violently
the
idea
self
taught
feral
attempting
connect
obelisk
cNo
Ykka
expression
flattens
Lerna
stares
you
incredulous
that
you
would
achieve
your
goal
and
then
scuttle
the
same
breath
Quickly
you
amend
yourself
cIt
dangerous
even
for
and
done
before
Well
that
does
safer
that
she
not
know
but
Lerna
right
you
have
win
this
woman
over
you
going
living
her
comm
cPromise
you
won
try
tell
you
won
promise
rusting
thing
don
know
you
Ykka
folds
her
arms
You
big
woman
but
she
little
bigger
and
the
hair
doesn
help
Many
Sanzeds
like
grow
their
ashblow
hair
into
big
poufy
manes
like
hers
animal
intimidation
thing
and
works
they
got
the
confidence
back
Ykka
got
that
and
then
some
But
you
have
knowledge
You
push
your
feet
and
meet
her
eyes
cYou
can
you
say
will
her
believe
cYou
don
have
the
training
cYou
don
know
what
kind
training
have
And
you
blink
remembering
that
moment
topside
when
the
realization
that
you
lost
Nassun
trail
nearly
unhinged
you
That
strange
sweeping
waft
power
Ykka
sent
through
you
like
slap
but
kinder
and
somehow
orogenic
Then
there
her
little
trick
drawing
orogenes
from
miles
around
toward
Castrima
Ykka
may
not
wear
rings
but
orogeny
isn
about
rank
help
for
then
cAn
obelisk
you
say
relenting
You
glance
Lerna
blinks
and
frowns
cAlabaster
wants
call

can
your
surprise
Ykka
nods
her
eyes
alight
cAha
Always
thought
there
was
something
about
those
things
Let
then
definitely
want

this
Shit
Ykka
shrugs
the

cGive
half
hour
then
meet

Ykka
meets
you
the
overlook
half
hour
With
her
are
four
other
Castrimans
who
are
armed
and
dressed
faded
colors
and
grays
for
camouflage
the
surface
harder
procession
going
than
was
coming
down:
lots
uphill
walking
many
sets
stairs
You
not
out
breath
few
Ykka
crew
the
time
done
but
then
you
been
walking
miles
every
day
while
they
been
living
safe
and
comfy
their
underground
town
(Ykka
you
notice
only
breathes
little
harder
She
keeping
shape
Eventually
though
you
reach
false
basement
one
the
decoy
houses
topside
not
the
same
basement
that
you
entered
through
which
shouldn
surprise
you
course
their
cgate
has
multiple
entrances
and
exits
The
underground
passages
are
more
complicated
than
you
initially
thought
though
something
important
keep
mind
should
you
ever
need
leave
hurry
The
decoy
house
has
Strongback
sentries
like
the
other
one
some
guarding
the
basement
entrance
and
some
actually
the
house
upstairs
keeping
watch
the
road
outside
When
the
upstairs
sentries
give
you
the
all
clear
you
head
out
into
the
late
evening
ashfall
After
what
less
than
day
Castrima
geode
amazing
how
strange
the
surface
seems
you
For
the
first
time
weeks
you
notice
the
sulfur
stench
the
air
the
silvery
haze
the
incessant
soft
patter
fat
ash
flakes
the
ground
and
dead
leaves
The
silence
which
makes
you
realize
just
how
noisy
Castrima
under
with
people
talking
and
pulleys
squeaking
and
smithies
clanking
and
the
omnipresent
hum
the
geode
strange
hidden
machinery
here
there
nothing
The
trees
have
dropped
their
leaves
nothing
moves
through
the
curl
edged
desiccated
detritus
birdsong
can
heard
through
the
branches
most
birds
stop
marking
territory
and
mating
during
Season
and
song
only
attracts
predators
other
animal
sounds
There
are
travelers
the
road
though
you
can
tell
that
the
ash
thinner
there
People
have
been
recently
Aside
from
that
though
even
the
wind
still
The
sun
has
set
though
there
still
plenty
light
the
sky
The
clouds
even
this
far
south
still
reflect
the
Rifting
cTraffic
Ykka
asks
one
the
sentries
cFamily

minutes

his
voice
appropriately
low
cWell

Maybe
twenty

Traveling

That
makes
everyone
look
him
Ykka
repeats:
cNorth

The
sentry
who
has
the
most

looks
back
Ykka
and
shrugs
cLooked

cHuh
She
folds
her
arms
shivering
little
though
not
particularly
cold
outside
the
cold
Fifth
Season
takes
months
set
fully
Castrima
under
just
warm
that
someone
used
that
Castrima
over
chilly
maybe
Ykka
just
reacting
the
starkness
the
comm
around
her
many
silent
houses
dead
gardens
and
ash
occluded
pathways
where
people
once
walked
You
been
thinking
the
surface
level
the
comm
bait
and
honeypot
meant
draw
the
desirable
and
distract
the
hostile
Yet
was
also
real
comm
once
alive
and
bright
and
anything
but
still
cWell
Ykka
takes
deep
breath
and
smiles
but
you
think
her
smile
strained
She
nods
toward
the
low
hanging
ash
clouds
cIf
you
need
see
this
thing
don
think
you
going
have
much
luck
anytime
soon
She
right
the
air
haze
ash
and
past
the
beaded
red
tinted
clouds
you
can
see
damned
thing
You
step
off
the
porch
and
look
the
sky
anyway
unsure
how
begin
You
also
aren
sure
you
should
begin
After
all
the
first
and
second
times
you
tried
interact
with
obelisk
you
almost
died
Then
there
the
fact
that
Alabaster
wants
this
when
the
man
who
destroyed
the
world
Maybe
you
shouldn
anything
asks
never
hurt
you
though
The
world
has
but
not
him
Maybe
the
world
deserved
destroyed
And
maybe
earned
little
your
trust
after
all
these
years
you
close
your
eyes
and
try
still
your
thoughts
There
are
sounds
heard
around
you
you
notice
last
Faint
creaks
and
pops
the
wooden
parts

the

the

Several

among

nothing

about
One
the
Castrimans
breathing
really
loudly
for
some
reason
Warm
jitter
the
earth
beneath
your
feet
Wrong
direction
There
actually
enough
ash
the
sky
that
you
can
sort
grasp
the
clouds
with
your
awareness
Ash
powdered
rock
after
all
But
not
the

You

you
sharply
west
You

The

Lines

Yes
And
there
far
along
the
line
your

you

your

something
heavy
and
dark
Dark
dark
Alabaster

This
isn

reminds
you

Not
the

Why
The
garnet
was
broken
mad
(you
not
sure
why
this
word
occurs
you
but
beyond
that
was
also
more
powerful
somehow
though
power
too
simple
word
for
what
these
things
contain
Richness
Strangeness
Darker

deeper
potential
But
that
the

cOnyx

Other
obelisks

along

your

closer

but
they
don
respond
this
near
instinctive
call
yours
The
dark
obelisk
far
away
well
past
the
Western
Coastals
somewhere
over
the
Unknown
Sea
Even
flying
might
take
months
arrive
But
But
The
onyx
hears
you
You
know
this
the
way
you
once
knew
your
children
had
heard
you
even
they
pretended
ignore
you
Ponderously

Then

Evil

You
flinch
back
along
the
line
that
leads
yourself
Along
the
way
something
snags
your
attention
and
almost
afterthought
you
call
too:
the
topaz
lighter
livelier
much
closer
and
somehow
more
responsive
perhaps
because
you
perceive
hint
Alabaster
its
interstices
like
curl
citrus

added

dish
prepped
for
you
Then
you
snap
back
into
yourself
and
turn
Ykka

frowning

cYou

She
shakes
her

caught

are

use
Shit

You

you
can

Ykka
looks
affronted
Well
she
Sanzed
they
invented
batteries
know
what
rusting
battery
First
hint
shake
and
you
got
acid
burns
top
everything
else
all
for
the
sake
bit
stored
juice
She
shakes
her
head
cWhat
you
talking
about
isn
battery
cThey
were
making
sugar
batteries
when
left
Yumenes
you
say
She
not
saying
obelisk
either
Good
she
gets
cSafer
than
acid
and
metal
Batteries
can
made
more
than
one
way
But
battery
too
powerful
for
the
circuit
you
attach
You
figure
that
enough
get
the
idea
across
She
shakes
her
head
again
but
you
think
she
believes
you
she
turns
and
starts
pace
thought
you
notice
Lerna
been
quiet
all
this
time
listening
you
and
Ykka
talk
Now
seems
deep
thought
and
that
bothers
you
You
don
like
that
still
thinking
hard
about
this
But
then
surprises
you
cYkka
How
old
you
think
this
comm
really
She
stops
and
frowns
him
The
other
Castrimans
shift
uncomfortable
Maybe
bothers
them
being
reminded
that
they
live
deadciv
ruin
cNo
clue
Why
shrugs
just
thinking
similarities
You
understand
then
Crystals
Castrima
under
that
glow
through
some
means
you
can
fathom
Crystals
that
float
the
sky
some
means
you
can
fathom
Both
mechanisms
meant
used
orogenes
and
one
else
Stone
eaters
showing
inordinate
interest
orogenes
who
use
either
You
glance
Hoa
But
Hoa
isn
looking
the
sky
you
stepped
off
the
porch
and
has
crouched
the
ashy
ground
just
off
the
walkway
staring
something
You
follow
his
gaze
and
see
small
mound
what
was
once
the
front
yard
the
house
next
door
looks
like
just
another
pile
ash
maybe
three
feet
high
but
then
you
notice
tiny
desiccated
animal
foot
poking
out
one
end
Cat
maybe
rabbit
There
are
probably
dozens
small
carcasses
around
here
buried
under
the
ash
the
beginning
the
Season
likely
caused
huge
die
off
Odd
that
this
carcass
seems
have
accumulated
much
more
ash
than
the
ground
around
though
cToo
long
gone
eat
kid
says
one
the
men
who
also
noticed
Hoa
and
clearly
has
idea
what
the
ckid
Hoa
blinks
him
and
bites
his
lip
with
just
the
perfect
degree
unease
plays
the
child
well
Then
gets
and
comes
over
you
and
you
realize
not
playacting
Something
really
has
unnerved
him
cOther
things
will
eat
says
you
very
softly
cWe
should
What
cYou
not
afraid
anything
His
jaw
tightens
Jaw
full
diamond
teeth
Muscles
over
diamond
bones
wonder
never
let
you
try
lift
him
must
heavy
marble
But
says
afraid
things
that
will
hurt
you
And
you
believe
him
Because
you
suddenly
realize
that
been
the
commonality
all
his
strange
behavior
far
His
willingness
face
the
kirkhusa
which
might
have
been
too
fast
even
for
your
orogeny
His
ferocity
toward
other
stone
eaters
protecting
you
few
have
ever
tried
protect
you
your
life
impulse
that
makes
you
lift
hand
and
stroke
over
his
weird
white
hair
blinks
Something
comes
into
his
eyes
that
anything
but
inhuman
You
don
know
what
think
This
though
why
you
listen
him
cLet
you
say
Ykka
and
the
others
You
done
what
Alabaster
asked
You
suspect
won
displeased
the
extra
obelisk
when
you

already

maybe
finally
