ECAUSE
YOU
ARE

SSUN
should
not
need
remind
you
that
all
Nassun
knew
before
Found
Moon
was
Tirimo
and
the
ash
darkening
world
the
road
during
Fifth
Season
You
know
your
daughter
don
you
should
obvious
therefore
that
Found
Moon
becomes
something
she
never
believed
she
had
before:
true
home
not
newcomm
its
core
the
village
Jekity
which
was
city
before
the
Choking
Season
some
hundred
years
before
During
that
Season
Mount
Akok
blanketed
the
Antarctics
with
ash
but
that
not
what
nearly
killed
Jekity
since
the
city
had
vast
stores
and
sturdy
wood
and
slate
walls
the
time
Jekity
the
city
died
because
human
errors
compounded:
child
lighting
lantern
spilled
oil
which
set
off
fire
that
swept
the
western
end
the
comm
and
burned
third
before
people
managed
get
under
control
The
comm
headman
died
the
fire
and
when
three
qualified
candidates
stepped
forward
take
his
place
factionalism
and
infighting
meant
that
the
burned
section
the
wall
didn
get
rebuilt
quickly
enough
tibbit
run
small
furred
animals
that
swarm
like
ants
when
food
scarce
enough
swept
into
the
comm
and
took
care
anyone
too
slow
get
off
the
ground
and
the
comm
ground
level
storecaches
The
survivors
lasted
for
time
what
was
left
then
starved
the
time
the
sky
cleared
five
years
later
less
than
five
thousand
souls
remained
the
hundred
thousand
who
begun
the
Season
The
Jekity
now
even
smaller
The
poor
unskilled
repairs
made
the
wall
during
Choking
are
still
place
and
while
the
stores
have
been
elevated
and
replenished
sufficiently
meet
Imperial
standards
this
only
paper:
The
comm
has
done
bad
job
rotating
old
spoiled
stores
out
and
laying
new
Strangers
have
rarely
asked
join
Jekity
over
the
years
Even
Antarctic
standards
the
comm
seen
ill
fated
Its
young
people
usually
leave
talk
marry
their
way
into
other
growing
communities
where
jobs
are
more
plentiful
and
the
memory
suffering
does
not
linger
When
Schaffa
found
this
sleepy
terrace
farming
comm
ten
years
before
and
convinced
the
then
headwoman
Maite
allow
him
set
special
Guardian
facility
within
the
comm
walls
she
hoped
that
was
the
beginning
turnaround
for
her
home
Guardians
are
healthy
addition
any
community
aren
they
And
indeed
there
are
now
three
Guardians
Jekity
including
Schaffa
along
with
nine
children
varying
ages
There
were
ten
but
when
one
the
children
caused
brief
but
powerful
earthshake
amid
temper
tantrum
one
evening
the
child
vanished
Maite
did
not
ask
questions
good
know
the
Guardians
are
doing
their
jobs
Nassun
and
her
father
not
know
this
they
move
into
the
comm
though
others
will
eventually
tell
them
The
healers
elderly
doctor
and
forest
herbalist
spend
seven
days
getting
Jija
out
danger
because
develops
fever
not
long
after
the
surgery
his
wound
Nassun
tends
him
the
whole
while
When
becomes
clear
that
survive
however
Schaffa
introduces
them
Maite
who
delighted
learn
that
Jija
stoneknapper
The
comm
has
not
had
one
for
several
decades
they
been
sending
orders
knappers
the
comm
Deveteris
twenty
miles
away
There
old
empty
house
the
comm
with
attached
kiln
and
while
forge
would
been
more
useful
Jija
tells
her
can
make
work
Maite
gives
month
sure
and
listens
when
her
people
tell
her
that
Jija
polite
and
friendly
and
sensible
physically
hearty
too
since
recovering
from
that
wound
like
proper
Resistant
and
since
managed
survive
the
road
with
companion
but
little
girl
Everyone
notices
how
well
behaved
and
devoted
his
daughter
too
not
all
what
anyone
would
expect
rogga
Thus
the
end
the
month
Jija
receives
the
name
Jija
Resistant
Jekity
They
induct
him
with
ceremony
that
most
the
comm
has
never
seen
before
long
has
been
since
anyone
new
joined
the
comm
Maite
herself
had
look
the
details
the
ceremony
old
lore
book
Then
they
throw
party
which
very
nice
Jija
tells
them
honored
Nassun
remains
just
Nassun
one
calls
her
Nassun
Resistant
Tirimo
though
she
still
introduces
herself
that
way
upon
meeting
new
people
Schaffa
interest
her
simply
too
obvious
But
she
causes
trouble
the
people
Jekity
are
friendly
toward
her
they
are
toward
Jija
slightly
more
guarded
fashion
the
other
orogene
children
who
unashamedly
embrace
Nassun
for
everything
she
The
oldest
them
Coaster
boy
named
Eitz
who
speaks
with
strange
choppy
accent
that
Nassun
thinks
exotic

and
there

shadow

expression

nothing

one
who
welcomes

the
first
day
after
becomes
clear
that

will
live

leading
her
the
small
compound
that
Schaffa
people
have
built
over

Jekity

her
toward

gates
that

they
approach
cYumenes
had
the
Fulcrum
and
Jekity
has
this:
place
where
you
can

and
always
safe
Schaffa
and
the
other
Guardians
are
here
for
too
remember
This
ours
Found
Moon
has
walls
its
own
shaped
from
the
shafts
columnar
rock
that
dominate
this
area
but
these
are
uniformly
sized
and
perfectly
even
conformation
Nassun
doesn
even
have
sess
them
realize
they
have
been
raised
orogeny
Within
the
compound
are
handful
small
buildings
few
new
but
most
parts
old
Jekity
left
abandoned
the
comm
population
dwindled
Whatever
those
used
they
have
since
been
refurbished
into
house
for
the
Guardians
mess
hall
wide
tiled
practice
area
several
ground
level
storesheds
and
dormitory
for
the
children
The
other
children
fascinate
Nassun
Two
are
Westcoasters
small
and
brown
and
black
haired
and
angle
eyed
Sisters
and
they
look
named
Oegin
and
Ynegen
Nassun
has
never
seen
Westcoasters
before
and
she
stares
until
she
realizes
they
are
staring
her
turn
They
ask
touch
her
hair
and
she
asks
touch
theirs
back
This
makes
them
all
realize
how
strange
and
silly
request
that
and
they
giggle
and
become
instant
friends
without
head
petted
between
them
Then
there
Paido
another
Somidlatter
who
looks
like
got
more
than
little
Antarctic
him
because
his
hair
bright
yellow
and
his
skin
white
that
nearly
glows
The
others
tease
him
about
but
Nassun
tells
him
that
sometimes
she
burns
the
sun
too
though
she
carefully
doesn
mention
that
this
takes
the
better
part
day
rather
than
minutes
and
his
face
alights
The
other
children
are
all
from
lower
Somidlats
comms
and
all
have
visible
Sanzed
them
Deshati
was
training
become
stoneknapper
before
the
Guardians
found
her
and
she
asks
Nassun
all
sorts
questions
about
her
father
(Nassun
warns
her
off
talking
Jija
directly
Deshati
understands
once
though
she
sad
about
Wudeh
gets
sick
when
eats
certain
kinds
grain
and
very
small
and
frail
because
doesn
get
enough
good
food
though
his
orogeny
the
strongest
the
bunch
Lashar
looks
Nassun
coldly
and
sneers
her
accent
though
Nassun
can
tell
the
difference
between
how
she
speaks
and
how
Lashar
does
The
others
tell
her
because
Lashar
grandfather
was
Equatorial
and
her
mother
local
comm
Leader
Alas
Lashar
orogene
none
that
matters
anymore
but
her
upbringing
tells
Shirk
not
Shirk
name
but
she
won
tell
anyone
what
that
really
they
started
calling
her
that
after
she
tried
duck
out
chores
one
afternoon
(She
doesn
anymore
but
the
name
stuck
Peek
similarly
nicknamed
because
she
tremendously
shy
and
spends
most
her
time
hiding
behind
someone
else
She
has
only
one
eye
and
terrible
scar
down
the
side
her
face
where
her
grandmother
tried
stab
her
the
others
whisper
when
Peek
not
around
Her
real
name
Xif
Nassun
makes
ten
and
they
want
know
everything
about
her:
where
she
came
from
what
kinds
foods
she
likes
eat
what
life
was
like
Tirimo
has
she
ever
held
baby
kirkhusa
because
they
are
soft
And
whispers
they
ask
about
other
things
once
becomes
clear
that
Schaffa
favors
her
What
did
she
the
day
the
Rifting
How
did
she
learn
such
skill
with
orogeny
This
how
Nassun
discovers
that
rare
for
their
kind
born
orogene
parents
Wudeh
comes
the
closest
because
his
aunt
realized
what
was
and
taught
him
what
she
could
secret
but
this
amounted
little
more
than
how
not
ice
people
accident
Some
the
others
only
learned
that
lesson
the
hard
way
and
Oegin
grows
very
quiet
during
this
conversation
Deshati
actually
didn
know
she
was
orogene
until
the
Rifting
which
Nassun
finds
incomprehensible
She
the
one
who
asks
the
most
questions
but
quietly
when
the
others
are
not
around
and
tone
shame
Another
thing
Nassun
discovers
that
she
much
much
much
better
than
any
them
not
simply
matter
training
Eitz
has
had
years
more
training
than
her
and
yet
his
orogeny
thin
and
frail
Wudeh
body
Eitz
control
enough
harm
but
can
much
good
with
either
like
find
diamonds

cool
spot

hot

slice
harpoon
half
The
others
stare
when
Nassun
tries
explain
the
lattermost
and
then
Schaffa
comes
away
from
the
wall
nearby
building
(one
the
Guardians
always
watching
while
they
gather
and
train
and
play
take
her
for
walk
cWhat
you
not
understand
Schaffa
says
resting
hand
her
shoulder
they
walk
cis
that
orogene
skill
not
just
matter
practice
but
innate
ability
much
has
been
done
breed
the
gift
out
the
world
sighs
little
sounding
almost
disappointed
cThere
are
few
left
who
are
born
with
high
level
ability
cMy
father
killed
brother
because
Nassun
says
cUche
had
more
orogeny
than
All
ever
did
was
listen
with
though
and
say
weird
things
sometimes
made
laugh
She
keeps
the
words
soft
because
they
still
hurt
say
and
because
she
said
them
rarely
Jija
never
wanted
hear
she
has
had
one
with
whom
she
could
discuss
her
grief
until
now
They
over
the
southern
terraces
Jekity
successive
platforms
high
above
the
floor
lava
plain
valley
The
terraces
are
still
heavily
planted
with
grains
greens
and
beans
Some
the
plants
are
beginning
look
sickly
from
the
thinning
sunlight
This
will
probably
the
last
harvest
before
the
ash
clouds
get
too
thick
cYes
And
that
tragedy
little
one
sorry
Schaffa
sighs
cMy
brethren
have
done
their
job
too
well
think
warning
the
populace
about
the
dangers
untrained
orogenes
Not
that
any
those
warnings
were
false
Just
exaggerated
perhaps
shrugs
She
feels
flash
anger
that
this
exaggeration
why
her
father
looks
her
with
such
hate
sometimes
But
the
anger
nebulous
directionless
she
hates
the
world
not
anyone
particular
That
lot
hate
cHe
thinks
evil
she
finds
herself
saying
Schaffa
looks
her
for
long
moment
There
something
confused
his
gaze
for
moment
wondering
sort
frown
that
gets
from
time
time
Not
quite
intentionally
Nassun
sesses
him
fleeting
pass
and
yes
those
strange
silvery
threads
are
flaring
within
him
again
lacing
through
his
flesh
and
tugging
his
mind
from
somewhere
near
the
back
his
head
She
stops
soon
his
expression
clears
because
fiendishly
sensitive
her
uses
orogeny
and
does
not
like
her
doing
anything
without
his
permission
But
when
being
tugged
the
bright
threads
notices
less
cYou
aren
evil
says
firmly
cYou
are
exactly
nature
made
you
And
that
special
Nassun
special
and
powerful
ways
that
are
atypical
even
for
one
your
kind
the
Fulcrum
you
would
have
rings
now
Perhaps
four
even
five
For
one
your
age
that
amazing
This
makes
Nassun
happy
even
though
she
doesn
fully
understand
cWudeh
says
the
Fulcrum
rings
ten
Wudeh
has
the
most
talkative
the
three
Guardians
agate
eyed
Nida
Nida
sometimes
says
things
that
don
make
sense
but
the
rest
the
time
she
shares
useful
wisdom
all
the
kids
have
learned
simply
tune
out
the
gibbering
cYes
ten
For
some
reason
Schaffa
seems
displeased
this
cBut
this
not
the
Fulcrum
Nassun
Here
you
must
train
yourself
since
have
senior
orogenes
train
you
And
that
good
because
there
are
things
you
can
His
face
twitches
Flicker
silver
through
him
again
then
quiescence
cThings
you
are
needed
which
things
that
Fulcrum
training
cannot
Nassun
considers
this
for
the
moment
ignoring
the
silver
cThings
like
making
orogeny
away
She
knows
her
father
has
asked
this
Schaffa
cThat
would
possible
when
you
reach
certain
point
development
But
reach
that
point
best
that
you
learn
use
your
powers
with
preconceptions
glances
her
His
expression
noncommittal
but
somehow
she
knows:
does
not
want
her
changing
into
still
even
does
become
possible
cYou
lucky
have
been
born
orogene
who
was
skilled
enough
manage
you
child
You
must
have
been
very
dangerous
your
infancy
and
early
years
Nassun
turn
shrug
this
She
lowers
her
gaze
and
scuffs
weed
that
has
worked
its
way
between
two
basalt
columns
guess
glances
her
his
gaze
sharpening
Whatever
wrong
with

and
there

with

vanishes
whenever
she

can
sess

cTell
more

does
not
want

about

cShe
probably
dead
seems
likely
though
she
remembers

effort
shunt
the

away
from
Tirimo
People
would
noticed
that
though
wouldn
they
Mama
always
warned
Nassun
against
doing
orogeny
during
shake
because
that
how
most
orogenes
get
discovered
And
Uche
what
happens
when

cPerhaps

Looks

Nassun
shrugs
again
thrusting
her
hands
into
her
pockets

hate

she
tells
him
not

surely

think
less

Maybe
will

Schaffa
moves
sit
nearby
terrace
wall
also
keeps
watching
her
smiling
politely
Waiting
Which
makes
Nassun
think
third
worse
possibility:
What
she
refuses
tell
him
and
gets
angry
and
kicks
her
and
her
father
out
Found
Moon
Then
she
will
have
nothing
left
but
Jija
And
she
sneaks
another
look
Schaffa
His
brow
has
furrowed
slightly
not
displeasure
but
concern
The
concern
does
not
seem
false
concerned
about
her
one
has
shown
concern
for
her
year
Thus
finally
Nassun
says
cWe
would
out
place
near
the
end
the
valley
away
from
Tirimo
She
would
tell
Daddy
she
was
taking
out
hunting
for
herbs
Schaffa
nods
That
something
that
children
are
normally
taught
comms
outside
the
Equatorial
node
network
useful
skill
should
Season
come
cShe
would
call
girl
time
Daddy
used
laugh
cAnd
you
practiced
orogeny
there
Nassun
nodded
looking
her
hands
cShe
would
talk
about
when
Daddy
wasn
home
Girl
talk
Discussions
wave
mechanics
and
math
Endless
quizzes
Anger
when
Nassun
did
not
answer
quickly
correctly
cBut
the
Tip
the
place
she
took
was
just
practice
She
had
drawn
circles
the
ground
had
push
around
boulder
and
torus
couldn
get
any
wider
than
the
fifth
ring
and
then
the
fourth
and
then
the
third
Sometimes
she
would
throw
the
boulder
Terrifying
have
three
tons
stone
rumbling
along
the
ground
toward
her
and
wonder
can
will
Mama
stop
She
had
done
that
question
remains
unanswered
Schaffa
chuckles
cAmazing
Nassun
look
confusion
adds
cThat
precisely
how
orogene
children
are
were
trained
the
Fulcrum
But
seems
your
training
was
substantially
accelerated
tilts
his
head
again
considering
cIf
you
had
only
occasional
practice
sessions
conceal
them
from
your
father
Nassun
nods
Her
left
hand
flexes
closed
and
then
open
again
its
own
cShe
said
there
wasn
time
teach
the
gentle
way
and
anyway
was
too
strong
She
had
what
would
work
see
Yet
she
can
feel
him
watching
her
waiting
knows
there
more
prompts
cIt
must
have
been
challenging
though
Nassun
nods
Shrugs
hated
yelled
her
once
Told
her
she
was
mean
told
her
hated
her
and
she
couldn
make
Schaffa
breathing
when
the
silver
light
not
stuttering
flickering
within
him
remarkably
even
She
has
thought
before
that
sounds
like
sleeping
person
steady
She
listens
him
breathe
not
asleep
but
calming
nevertheless
cShe
got
really
quiet
Then
she
said
Are
you
sure
you
can
control
yourself
And
she
took
hand
She
bites
her
lip
then
cShe
broke
Schaffa
breath
pauses
just
for
instant
cYour
hand
Nassun
nods
She
draws
finger
across
her
palm
where
each
the
long
bones
connecting
wrist
knuckle
still
ache
sometimes
when
cold
After
says
nothing
more
she
can
continue
cShe
said
didn
matter
hated
her
didn
matter
didn
want
good
orogeny
Then
she
took
hand
and
said
don
ice
anything
She
had
round
rock
and
she
hit
hand
with
The
sound
stone
striking
flesh
Wet
popping
sounds
her
mother
set
the
bones
Her
own
voice
screaming
Her
mother
voice
cutting
through
the
pounding
blood
her
ears:
You
fire
Nassun
You
lightning
dangerous
unless
captured
wires
But
you
can
control
yourself
through
pain
know
you
safe
didn
ice
anything
After
that
her
mother
had
taken
her
home
and
told
Jija
that
Nassun
had
fallen
and
caught
herself
badly
True
her
word
she
never
made
Nassun
the
Tip
with
her
again
Jija
had
remarked
later
how
quiet
Nassun
had
become
that
year
Just
something
that
happens
when
girls
start
grow
Mama
had
said
Daddy
was
Jija
then
Mama
had
Essun
Schaffa
very
quiet
knows
what
she
now
though:
child
willful
that
her
own
mother
broke
her
hand
make
her
mind
girl
whose
mother
never
loved
her
only
refined
her
and
whose
father
will
only
love
her
again
she
can
the
impossible
and
become
something
she
not
cThat
was
wrong
Schaffa
says
His
voice
soft
she
can
barely
hear
She
turns
look
him
surprise
staring
the
ground
and
there
strange
look
his
face
Not
the
usual
wandering
confused
look
that
gets
sometimes
This
something
actually
remembers
and
his
expression
guilty
Rueful
Sad
cIt
wrong
hurt
someone
you
love
Nassun
Nassun
stares
him
Her
own
breath
catches
and
she
doesn
notice
until
her
chest
aches
and
she
forced
suck
air
wrong
hurt
someone
you
love
wrong
wrong
has
always
been
wrong
Then
Schaffa
lifts
hand
her
She
takes
pulls
and
she
falls
willingly
and
then
she
his
arms
and
they
are
very
tight
and
strong
around
her
the
way
her
father
have
not
been
since
before
killed
Uche
that
moment
she
does
not
care
that
Schaffa
cannot
possibly
love
her
when
has
known
her
for
only
few
weeks
She
loves
him
She
needs
him
She
will
anything
for
him
With
her
face
pressed
into
Schaffa
shoulder
Nassun
sesses
when
the
silver
flicker
happens
again
This
time
contact
with
him
she
also
feels
the
slight
flinch
his
muscles
barely
fluctuation
and
might
anything:
bug
bite
shiver
the
cooling
evening
breeze
Somehow
though
she
realizes
that
actually
pain
Frowning
against
his
uniform
Nassun
cautiously
reaches
toward
that
strange
place
the
back
Schaffa
head
where
the
silver
threads
come
from
They
are
hungry
the
threads
somehow
she
gets
closer
them
they
lick
her
seeking
something
Curious
Nassun
touches
them
and
sesses
what
faint
tug
Then
she
tired
Schaffa
flinches
again
and
pulls
back
holding
her
arm
length
cWhat
are
you
doing
She
shrugs
awkwardly
cYou
needed
You
were
hurting
Schaffa
turns
his
head
from
side
side
slowly
not
negation
but
checking
for
something
expects
there
which
now
gone
always
hurting
little
one
part
what
Guardians
are
But
His
expression
wondering
this
Nassun
knows
the
pain
gone
least
for
now
cYou
always
hurting
She
frowns
cIs
that
thing
your
head
His
gaze
snaps
back
her
immediately
She
has
never
been
afraid
his
icewhite
eyes
even
now
they
turn
very
cold
cWhat
She
points
the
back
her
own
skull
where
the
sessapinae
are
located
she
knows
from
lectures
biomestry
creche
cThere
little
thing
you
Here
don
know
what
but
sessed
when
met
you
When
you
touched
neck
She
blinks
understanding
cYou
took
something
then
make
bother
you
less
cYes
did
reaches
around
her
head
now
and
sets
two
his
fingers
just
the
top
her
spine
beneath
the
back
edge
her
skull
This
touch
not
relaxed
other
times
has
touched
her
The
two
fingers
are
stiffened
held
pantomiming
knife
Only
isn
pantomiming
she
realizes
She
remembers
that
day
the
forest
when
they
reached
Found
Moon
and
the
bandits
attacked
them
Schaffa
very
very
strong
easily
strong
enough
push
two
fingers
through
bone
and
muscle
like
paper
wouldn
have
needed
rock
break
her
hand
Schaffa
gaze
searches
hers
and
finds
that
she
understands
precisely
what
thinking
about
doing
cYou
aren
afraid
She
shrugs
cTell
why
you
aren
His
voice
brooks
disobedience
cJust
She
cannot
help
shrugging
again
She
can
really
figure
out
how
say
don
mean
you
have
good
reason
cYou
have
inkling
reasons
little
one
know
She
scowls
more
out
frustration
with
herself
than
anything
else
Then
explanation
occurs
her
cDaddy
didn
have
reason
when
killed
little
brother
when
knocked
her
off
the
wagon
any
the
half
dozen
times
looked
Nassun
and
thought
about
killing
her
obviously
that
even
ten
year
old
can
figure
out
icewhite
blink
What
happens
then
fascinating
watch:
Slowly
Schaffa
expression
thaws
from
the
contemplation
her
murder
into
wonder
again
and
sorrow
deep
that
makes
lump
come
Nassun
throat
cAnd
you
have
seen
much
purposeless
suffering
that
least
being
killed
for
reason
can
borne
much
better
talking
She
nods
emphatically
Schaffa
sighs
She
feels
his
fingers
waver
cBut
this
not
thing
that
can
known
beyond
order
let
child
live
once
who
saw
but
should
not
have
And
both
suffered
for
compassion
remember
that
don
want
you
suffer
Nassun
says
She
puts
her
hands
his
chest
wills
the
silver
flickers
within
him
take
more
They
begin
drift
toward
her
cIt
always
hurts
That
isn
right
cMany
things
ease
the
pain
Smiling
for
example
releases
specific
endorphins
which
jerks
and
takes
his
hand
from
the
back
her
neck
grabbing
her
hands
and
pulling
them
away
from
him
just
the
silver
threads
find
her
actually
looks
alarmed
cThat
will
kill
you
cYou
going
kill
anyway
This
seems
sensible
her
stares
cEarth
our
fathers
and
mothers
But
with
that
slowly
the
killing
tension
begins
bleed
out
his
posture
After
moment
sighs
cNever
speak
what
you
sess
around
the
others
the
other
Guardians
learn
that
you
know
may
not
able
protect
you
Nassun
nods
won
Will
you
tell
what
cSomeday
perhaps
gets
his
feet
Nassun
hangs
his
hand
when
tries
pull
away
frowns
her
bemused
but
she
grins
and
swings
his
hand
little
and
after
moment
shakes
his
head
Then
they
head
back
into
the
compound
and
that
the
first
day
Nassun
thinks
