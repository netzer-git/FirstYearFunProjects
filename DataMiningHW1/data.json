It takes about 20 minutes into this series pilot episode to understand where this comedy/drama /musical/dance series journey is taking us but what a pleasant ride we are taken on.Kudos to the team of creative writers and to the choreographers who made me forget how great West Side Story was, and hey, who doesn't like a few Beatles song dropped into Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist?Jane Levy was so good in her previous TV series, Suburgatory, and she is fantastic in this her new series. The supporting cast is top notch and I see a bright future for this TV series. Stay tuned for some more great musical and dance numbers with top notch story lines. We have a new hit on our hands!\n\n\n\n\n                99 of 124 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 347 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n do any of the actors sing the songs or are they mostly lip synced.\n\n\nQ:\n Does anyone know or ever heard why or what caused Zoey's dad to be in a catatonic state?

Thirsty for innovation and hungry for success, the son of a tailor manages to open a wax museum; however, he soon shifts focus to the unique and the peculiar, introducing extraordinary, never-seen-before live acts on the circus stage. Now, some people call Barnum's rich collection of oddities, an outright freak show; but, when Phineas, obsessed for cheers and respectability, gambles everything on the opera singer, Jenny Lind, to appeal to a high-brow audience, he will lose sight of the most crucial aspect of his life: his family. Will Barnum, the greatest showman, risk it all to be accepted?\nWritten by\nNick Riganas \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n circus\n|\n singing\n|\n bearded lady\n|\n social outcast\n|\n social prejudice\n|\u00a0See All (96)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nExperience the award-winning music!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Biography\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for thematic elements including a brawl\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Barnum's wife's family's name is \"Hallett.\" This is pronounced the same way as \"Howlett,\" which was the last name of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character (James \"Logan\" Howlett) from the X-Men movies.

I love quality cinema. Not since Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) has a motion picture so successfully combined these two elements. I wouldn't be surprised if it won the same awards as Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Michael Gracey skillfully brought together the best music, choreography, cast, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, and set decoration I have seen in recent years, all fresh and original, and integrated them into nothing short of a masterpiece.\n\n\n\n\n                537 of 675 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,926 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Did Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams sing their own songs?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official Instagram\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 28 December 2017 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ha'oman ha'gadol mi'koulam\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\n1 E 78th St, New York City, New York, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$84,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $8,805,843,\n24 December 2017 \n\nGross USA: $174,340,174        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $435,440,980        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Bona Film Group, Chernin Entertainment, TSG Entertainment \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n105 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| Dolby Atmos\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The club competes in the choir competition circuit. It's been called \"a High School Musical for adults\", the series follows the club and its mixture of oddball members as they try and restore it to its former glory. It is a musical comedy in which the eager and ambitious students not only compete to win the Nationals, but also have to deal with the tough and cruel realities of their school, McKinley High. At the same time, Will is trying to rejuvenate his failing love life while preventing the school's cheer leading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) from sabotaging the choir.\nWritten by\nWellardRockard \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n glee club\n|\n competition\n|\n singing\n|\n wheelchair\n|\n student athlete\n|\u00a0See All (36)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nGleek out!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Neil Patrick Harris and Jayma Mays appeared in The Smurfs (2011) (2011) and The Smurfs 2 (2013) (2013).

With music, well written characters and a simple storyline, Glee changed the game. This show made people talk and made people sing. It could've been a mess from the beginning, but Ryan Murphy did a pretty good job until the last three seasons. I would like to remember Glee as a TV series that helped others in a way no other TV show could at that moment. We have to be honest, even if you hated it or liked it: before Glee there were no other show as open minded as this one. Glee, at the end of the day, is an optimistic, happy, and simple show. It doesn't try to be more than what it is, but as far as Glee can go, it had a pretty good run.\n\n\n\n\n                57 of 69 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 254 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is the real name of the characters?\n\n\nQ:\n Shouldn't students be graduating now?

I went to a Christian summer camp growing up despite that and I loved it. Some of my happiest memories are from that camp. However, I didn't go into this film with the knowledge of it being a Christian film. I thought it'd be just a cute summer camp movie. Imagine my surprise when I was blasted by a God worshipping song within the first 7 minutes. Even with my discomfort, I stuck around and finished the film. While I don't agree with the heavy religious stuff it was still pretty nice. I won't be showing it to any kids anytime soon but for teenagers who already have their own beliefs, I think this is a good film. Definitely something cute to have on in the background.\n\n\n\n\n                17 of 27 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 119 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Featuring a score that blends hip-hop, jazz, R&B, and show tunes, \"Hamilton\" has taken the story of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and created a revolutionary moment in theater--a musical that has had a profound impact on culture, politics, and education. Captured at the Richard Rodgers Theater on Broadway in June 2016, the film transports its audience into the world of the Broadway show in a uniquely intimate way.\nWritten by\nThe Walt Disney Studios \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n cultural appropriation\n|\n revolutionary war\n|\n hip hop\n|\n broadway musical\n|\n american history\n|\u00a0See All (31)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAn American Musical                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Biography\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n History\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for language and some suggestive material\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The cost of filming the show in June 2016 for later exhibition as an independent movie was financed by its three main producers for less than $10 million. In February 2020, Disney paid $75 million for the worldwide rights to release it, believed to be the largest price ever paid for a single film acquisition. Other studios that expressed interest in the film rights included Warner Bros. Pictures, 20th Century Fox (which would eventually be acquired by Disney) and Netflix.

Eacker, following suit, did not shoot either. For the first minute, both men stood, doing nothing, both refusing to shoot. After a minute, Eacker finally raised his pistol, and Philip did the same. Eacker shot and struck Philip above his right hip. The bullet went through his body and lodged in his left arm. In what may have been an involuntary spasm, Philip also fired his pistol before he hit the ground, but this bullet did nothing.\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nQuotes\n[first lines]\nKing George:\nLadies and gentlemen, this is your king, George III.

The producers should be ashamed of themselves. Just cause there good looking doesn't mean it will be a good TV show. The actors are so bad my dog can act better than that. The producers seriously need 2 get better actors the story lines are predictable not to mention their voices are horrible i can't believe their a band. This one of the worst boy bands. I can't think of a good thing about this show. If you want my advice don't bother watching barney is more interesting and that says a lot. I would never let my sister watch this show. This shows are rubbish these days especially this show one of the worst shows i've ever seen in my life\n\n\n\n\n                7 of 20 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 54 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Scar killing Mufasa is directly taken from Cain and Abel as like Scar Cain killed his brother Abel. One of the 10 plagues from the bible in this case fire and thunderstorms takes place during and after the climax. Just how God banished Adam and Eve from Eden Scar exiles Simba for 'causing' Mufasa's death and Simba seeing the ghost of his father is similar to Jacob's ladder where Jacob dreamed he visited God in heaven and both Mufasa and God offer words of wisdom.

Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he's groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later\u2014as an adult\u2014he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****\n\n\n\n\n                98 of 116 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,078 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why was Nala away from Pride Rock when she tried to hunt down first Pumbaa, then Timon?\n\n\nQ:\n Why are there only two male lions amongst the large group of lionesses?\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the theatrical cut and the Special Edition?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nSwahili\n|\nXhosa\n|\nZulu\n\n\nRelease Date: 23 June 1994 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Melech Ha-Arayot\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures - 500 S.

When her island's fishermen can't catch any fish and the crops fail, she learns that the demigod Maui caused the blight by stealing the heart of the goddess, Te Fiti. The only way to heal the island is to persuade Maui to return Te Fiti's heart, so Moana sets off on an epic journey across the Pacific. The film is based on stories from Polynesian mythology.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n island\n|\n ocean\n|\n polynesia\n|\n polynesian\n|\n saving the world\n|\u00a0See All (121)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe ocean is calling.        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for peril, some scary images and brief thematic elements\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Walt Disney Animation Studios' fourteenth film to be rated PG by the MPAA after The Black Cauldron (1985), The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), Dinosaur (2000), Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001).

It could create life itself. And Te Fiti shared it with the world. But in time, some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

Yes, they made a mediocre over-hyped movie named Frozen, read my previous review for my thoughts about that movie. Moana really doesn't disappoint it has a good pacing, a great cast, and it is BEAUTIFUL. I could just leave my review at this and tell you to go and watch this movie, but let's see \"How Far I'll Go\".Moana is a story that takes place in Ancient Polynesia, when a curse reaches the island Mata Nui a chieftain's daughter is determined to go on a journey, to find a demigod named Maui in order to stop the curse.Like most Disney movies this is a coming of age story. Moana is a chieftain's daughter who is struggling with her love for her people and her love for the ocean. She is determined and a strong character. It is wonderful to see her grow and find herself throughout the movie. She is voiced by Auli'I Cravaljo and it fits like a glove, perfect love her accent. Moana is joined by a demigod named Maui. He starts out as an egotistical/funny character but we quickly learn why and see him change for the better. He is voiced by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and if you know The Rock YOU know what to expect. You can never go wrong with The Rock.Other supporting characters were there to setup the plot and exposition.The music, as expected, was typically Disney which is a good thing because I love Disney songs. After the movie you just can't get it out of your head. All the scores were very good. It did the basics like underscoring a scene but it also carried the movie for a huge part.The three-act-structure. Moana has a great beginning, good middle, and a great ending. Furthermore, the pacing of this movie is fast in a good way. It doesn't hold on to a scene for too long and the movie knows when to cut.The cinematography was beautiful it really shows that the creators have done their research. I love the bright colors and gorgeous sceneries. It would appear that Disney's new approach to movie making is starting to pay-off, by remaking their old animated movies into real-life and mocking their old movies with their new 3d-animated movies, they are breathing new life into their movies. As aforementioned in the introduction Moana is a must see movie that won't disappoint.I give this movie a 8.5.\n\n\n\n\n                52 of 92 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 561 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Who plays Moana's grandmother?\n\n\nQ:\n Why is the movie called \"Vaiana\" in many European countries?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Disney+ Hotstar\n    \n|\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 8 December 2016 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Moana\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nPolynesia\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$150,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $56,631,401,\n27 November 2016 \n\nGross USA: $248,757,044        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $643,350,998        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Hurwitz Creative, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Walt Disney Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n107 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Atmos\n| DTS\n(DTS: X)| Dolby Surround 7.1\n| Dolby Digital\n| 12-Track Digital Sound\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But Marni Nixon's singing in the film is superb.  Audrey Hepburn looks the part.  Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway leave their defining performances of Higgins and Doolittle for us to enjoy, the supporting cast are fine - Gladys Cooper, Jeremy Brett, Mona Washbourne, Theodore Bikel and the incomparable Wilfred Hyde-White. Cecil Beaton's designs bring the screen to life and in the newly restored version it looks 'loverly'.

At the center of the show is Usnavi, a bodega owner who looks after the aging Cuban lady next door, pines for the gorgeous girl working in the neighboring beauty salon and dreams of winning the lottery and escaping to the shores of his native Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, Nina, a childhood friend of Usnavi's, has returned to the neighborhood from her first year at college with surprising news for her parents, who have spent their life savings on building a better life for their daughter. Ultimately, Usnavi and the residents of the close-knit neighborhood get a dose of what it means to be home.\nWritten by\nBroadway.com \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n based on play\n|\u00a0See All (1)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Time Has Come                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for some language and suggestive references\n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In 2017, Lin-Manuel Miranda announced he would not be playing Usnavi for the film version, however may play another role for the film, whether it's a side character or a cameo role        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nConnections\n        Referenced in WatchMojo: Top 10 Movies That Should've Been Released in 2020 (So Far)\u00a0(2020)\n\n\n        See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nSoundtracks\nEverything I Know \nMusic & Lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda \nPerformed by Leslie Grace  See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Who is the choreographer?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nSpanish\n\n\nRelease Date: 11 June 2021 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ao Ritmo de Washington Heights\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWashington Heights, New York City, New York, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Warner Bros., 5000 Broadway Productions, Likely Story \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n120 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Atmos\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

His only hope is to learn to love a young woman and earn her love in return in order to redeem himself. Ten years later, his chance shows itself when a young maiden named Belle (Paige O'Hara) offers to take her ill father Maurice's (Rex Everhart's) place as his prisoner. With help from the castle's enchanted staff, Belle learns to appreciate her captor and immediately falls in love with him. Back in the village however, unscrupulous hunter Gaston (Richard White) has his own plans for Belle.\nWritten by\nBlazer346 \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n france\n|\n rose\n|\n castle\n|\n fairy tale\n|\n chauvinism\n|\u00a0See All (227)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe most beautiful love story ever told as it has never been seen before.

Although he had everything his heart desired, the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind. But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away.

This is the unfinished preview version shown at the New York Film Festival in September 1991, with 80% of its animation complete, the remaining footage represented by sketches, drawings and painted storyboards. It runs the same length as the final cut and has no new scenes but includes 18 minutes of special features, including alternate version of \"Be Our Guest\" sung to Belle's father after he stumbles into the castle. It was decided to make \"Be Our Guest\" more of a show stopper and place it in the middle of the film to be sung to Belle. The alternate scene is all in pencil test.

I love the fact that even though Belle hated Beast at first, she saw underneath that he was a kind and gentle soul, and didn't care what he looked like on the outside! And what girl hasn't known a Gaston in their lives? I thought it was so great how he was put in his place! All the voiceovers are amazing, especially Robby Benson as Beast.

But as success mounts, they are faced with decisions that fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.\nWritten by\nEirini \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n musician\n|\n los angeles california\n|\n actress\n|\n pianist\n|\n aspiring actress\n|\u00a0See All (298)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nHere's to the fools who dream.        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for some language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Influences for this movie include the films of French New Wave director Jaques Demy. Demy broke the hyper-serious mold of 1960's movie making with candy colored musicals such as Umbrellas of Cherbourg, The Young Girls of Rochefort and A Room In Town. According to Chazelle, \" Jaques Demy is probably the single biggest influence not just on this movie but on everything I've done or wanted to do. There is no more formative movie for me than The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nAfter Mia and Seb leave the party to find her Prius, they walk to her car.

And, WOW, I was captivated by the two main characters...of course did not understand exactly what was happening. When I watched the whole movie I was even more impressed!!I love piano so I was already half in, however, some will be turned off by the \"musical\" aspects of the movie. Give it a chance, it is all part of the character depth and the La La feel to it. The ending was very interesting and felt real.I have so much to say, however, I'll keep my first review spoiler free. :)\n\n\n\n\n                16 of 23 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,913 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Did Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling sing their own parts?\n\n\nQ:\n Last scene: Emma/Mia is leaving the night club.

His adventures begin when he meets a young girl who happens to be Princess Jasmine, who is forced to be married by her wacky yet estranged father. Aladdin's luck suddenly changes when he retrieves a magical lamp from the Cave of Wonders. What he unwittingly gets is a fun-loving genie who only wishes to have his freedom. Little do they know is that the Sultan's sinister advisor Jafar has his own plans for both Aladdin and the lamp.\nWritten by\nBlazer346 \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n arab\n|\n genie\n|\n genie character\n|\n princess\n|\n cave\n|\u00a0See All (280)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nWish granted!

This record stood for only two years when it was beaten by the release of The Lion King (1994).        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nWhen Aladdin first notices Jasmine enter the marketplace, a side street or wide alley way separates the apple vendor's stand and the melon vendor's stand where Aladdin was sitting on the canopy, (easily seen in the opening long shots). Just after Jasmine is accused of stealing, the two stands are directly next to each other, against the same building, very evident when Aladdin first tries to turn Jasmine around to walk off. Then after Aladdin finally has convinced the apple vendor that Jasmine is crazy, Aladdin says \"Come along sis. time to see the doctor\", the side street between the two stands has reappeared, and the stands are at least several feet apart.

Great animation, fine songs, a decent plot--what is there not to like? I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.A great movie, ***1/2 outta ****, a fave then and now.\n\n\n\n\n                40 of 49 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 355 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The tickets start to be found, with the fifth going to a very special boy, called Charlie Bucket. With his Grandpa, Charlie joins the rest of the children to experience the most amazing factory ever. But not everything goes to plan within the factory.\nWritten by\nFilmFanUK \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n chocolate factory\n|\n caterpillar\n|\n psychiatrist\n|\n cannibalism\n|\n garbage\n|\u00a0See All (363)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nViolet Keeps her eyes on the prize                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for quirky situations, action and mild language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In the television room scene, the movie into which the chocolate bar is teleported is implied to be 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The ape's behavior towards the chocolate bar is a remake of the first scene of the movie, and the movie's theme music was also used in that scene.

However, the article text states that the boy who has \"found\" the Golden Ticket lives in St. Petersburg.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nQuotes\n[first lines]\nNarrator:\nThis is a story of an ordinary little boy named Charlie Bucket. He was not faster, or stronger, or more clever than other children. His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected; in fact, they barely had enough to eat. Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world. He just didn't know it yet.\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    After the end credits, the caption reads \"Plan B\".        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nThe HD-DVD and PAL Blu-Ray versions are slightly extended. This version is also rumored to have been shown on television. These scenes are extra dialogue between Mr. Teavee and Mr. Salt, Mike Teavee saying \"Back off, you little freaks!\" to an Oompa-Loompa, and extra lines in Augustus Gloop's Oompa-Loompa song.

I was a bit reluctant to go and watch this movie but I'm glad I did! Johnny Depp is a great Willy Wonka! I never thought that there would be a version that could match or even beat the original, but this one certainly has exceeded my expectations.... The film is hilarious, speaking as an adult, I wonder how the youth responds to this, but I rate this movie 8 out of 10 stars!For those of you expecting a copy of the original with new actors, you'll be surprised how original this version is, go and bring your entire family with you! I'm sorry for the fact that this comment looks a bit like a commercial, but I'm really enthusiastic about this flick!\n\n\n\n\n                239 of 451 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,467 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the theatrical release and the HD DVD / PAL Blu-ray release?\n\n\nQ:\n Where is Wonka Chocolate Factory located?\n\n\nQ:\n Is 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' based on a book?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUK\n|\nUSA\n|\nAustralia\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 21 July 2005 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Charlie y la f\u00e1brica de chocolate\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nUK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$150,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $56,178,450,\n17 July 2005 \n\nGross USA: $206,459,076        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $474,968,763        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures, The Zanuck Company \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n115 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS-ES\n| Dolby Digital EX\n| SDDS\n| Sonics-DDP\n(IMAX version)| DTS\n(DTS HD Master Audio 5.1)\u00a0(5.1 Surround)| Dolby Digital\n(Dolby Digital 5.1)\u00a0(5.1 Surround)| SDDS\n(8 channels)\u00a0(5.1 Surround)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And if that sounds interesting to you, you should definitely give HSMTMTS a try. And because this show is for the Disney+ streaming platform and not just Disney Channel, there was a certain maturity to the show that (excitingly) makes me believe that it's demographic isn't just kids who currently watch Disney, but for people who grew up with High School Musical. It's funny without being forced, and a refreshing new take on an established franchise.\n\n\n\n\n                70 of 83 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 77 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

I have just purchased the \"Special Edition\" version mainly because at last there is a wide-screen DVD version now available! This was one movie that suffered very greatly from a standard T.V format transfer ..... Now in wide-screen,it is possible to see the cinematography as it was intended to be viewed from the original Super Panavision format,even though there is still some \"enhanced\" format alteration to bring it into line with 16:9 ratio and luckily it was shot in Technicolor,which was easily the best analogue colour system around. Perspectives can now be seen as intended and the beautiful sets and the dance routines look vastly better... you can actually see all the dancers ! Take for instance one scene in Caractacus Potts windmill laboratory,where he shows Truly Scrumptious one of his inventions with which he intends to transmit \"pictures and sound\".....in the standard format half of the shot is missing so the machine cannot be fully seen and it makes no sense.. however in wide-screen you can see the \"picture\" and also the whole machine; so now you can enjoy one of Emmet Rolands fantasy machine creations in full. All through the movie the scenery and sets are set up framed with objects in the foreground and back ground which lend to perspective and depth of the image. The sound track seems also to have been worked on .. in previous releases the children's voices seemed to \"squeak\" but now they sound much more natural. You can see how much we have been missing with previous releases and it is a lot. The Special Edition also has some featurettes on the making of the movie and other related information plus a lovely booklet as well.As to the movie itself .... it has never lost it's magic for me. I see reviews which pan the musical numbers or say it's too long or thatafter seeing it as an adult they were disappointed from what they remember as a child ... but is that not the point ? It is a movie for children and/or those adults who can still view it remembering the child in themselves. It has no coarse language , no mindless violence (except the pantomime variety).. no cynicism ...just fun. In short it is a type of movie that Hollywood can no longer make because they no longer know how ... so it should be treasured more for it. People criticize Dick Van Dykes \"American\" accent but I find it not intrusive at all ... in fact he would probably have been better off using his normal voice in \"Mary Poppins\" than attempting the cockney accent which he obviously had some difficulty with.Kids love this movie .. let them be the judges.Thank-you Cubby Broccoli ..we miss you. Thank-you Ian Fleming / Roald Dahl / Richard Maibaum and Ken Hughes. Thank-you Ken Adam ... a genius in design for Chitty.\n\n\n\n\n                32 of 38 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 198 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why doesn't Dick Van Dyke use an English accent?\n\n\nQ:\n Is this movie based on a book?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUK\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGerman\n|\nFrench\n|\nLatin\n\n\nRelease Date: 17 December 1968 (UK)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Tschitti Tschitti B\u00e4ng B\u00e4ng\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nPinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$10,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nGross USA: $7,500,000        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $7,500,398        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Dramatic Features, Warfield \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n144 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\n70 mm 6-Track\n(70 mm prints)| Mono\n(35 mm prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.20 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While driving through Moose Lake, Minnesota, the truck that is transporting Blu accidentally drops Blu's box on the road. A girl, Linda, finds the bird and raises him with love. Fifteen years later, Blu is a domesticated and intelligent bird that does not fly and lives a comfortable life with bookshop owner Linda. Out of the blue, clumsy Brazilian ornithologist, Tulio, visits Linda and explains that Blu is the last male of his species, and he has a female called Jewel in Rio de Janeiro. He invites Linda to bring Blu to Rio so that he and Jewel can save their species. Linda travels with Blu and Tulio to Rio de Janeiro and they leave Blu and Jewel in a large cage in the institute where Tulio works. While they are having dinner, smugglers break into the institute and steal Blu and Jewel to sell them. Linda and Tulio look everywhere for Blu, who is chained to Jewel and hidden in a slum. Meanwhile, Jewel ...\nWritten by\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n brazil\n|\n bird\n|\n macaw\n|\n ornithologist\n|\n minnesota\n|\u00a0See All (119)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nHe's going to the wildest, most magical place on earth ... home.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Crime\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Both Blu and Jewel are Spix's macaws.

One of them is a blue parrot, and as it turns out, a very special one. Years later the wheels of fate have taken him into the loving hands of a woman that treats him very well, maybe a little too well. Fate is again turning on him and his presence is needed in Rio.And that's where this very colourful animation film really starts rolling. He quickly meets a number of friends and a necessary number of enemies and the rest of the story unfolds at a pleasantly quick pace.Animation wise this one is nice, but not more than nice. The colour scheme is just great, spot on for the type of film, but action wise it's too much of a kids film - there's too little fun stuff hidden under the surface to keep the adults happy.Story wise it's a little too rich on clich\u00e9s and the easy turns and tangles. It's not bad but it's not great. All in all, it works great on the children, and works OK on their parents/guardians.7 out of 10 feathers in a ruffle\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 6 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 223 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How could Tulio have known about the last Spix's Macaw (Blu) existing in Moose Lake, Minnesota?\n\n\nQ:\n Is there a sequel?\n\n\nQ:\n Approximately how much of Rio de Janiero is shown throughout the film?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nBrazil\n\n\nLanguage:\nArabic\n|\nEnglish\n|\nPortuguese\n\n\nRelease Date: 7 April 2011 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Rio\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$90,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $39,225,962,\n17 April 2011 \n\nGross USA: $143,619,809        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $483,866,518        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Twentieth Century Fox Animation, Blue Sky Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n96 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n| Datasat\n| SDDS\n| Dolby Surround 7.1\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Cinderella is a teenage girl forced to do all of the menial tasks in the home she shares with her coldhearted stepmother and homely stepsisters. One day when home alone, Cinderella shares a cup of water with a thirsty and handsome traveler, not realizing until he continues on his journey that he is the crown prince of the kingdom. Shortly thereafter, the king and queen invite every young maiden in the kingdom to a royal ball so that the crown prince can find a girl to marry. Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters go to the ball, leaving Cinderella behind to wish about how her life could be. While she is daydreaming, she is visited by her fairy godmother, who makes it possible for her wishes to come true.\nWritten by\nStephen Hughes \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n character name as title\n|\n cinderella character\n|\n fairy godmother character\n|\n troubador\n|\n step mother\n|\u00a0See All (30)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Features the song \"Loneliness of Evening\", which Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had deleted from their 1949 stage musical version of \"South Pacific\". (However, the song's lyrics did turn up in the movie version of South Pacific (1958) in the form of a poem that Emile de Becque sends to Nellie Forbush.)

Shout! Factory's 2014 DVD, sourced from the master tape, restored the full scene, as well as commercial bumpers and station identification.

I haven't seen it since the late '60s or so, but I still remember the songs and the overall feel of this classic (from a nine-year-old's point of view, of course). That just goes to show what a powerful effect a film can have when everything is done just right. One of these days I'll find this and watch again. Until then, I still have my memories.\n\n\n\n\n                26 of 29 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 57 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret: she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.\nWritten by\nDeAlan Wilson for ComedyE.com \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n magic\n|\n snowman\n|\n sister sister relationship\n|\n ice\n|\n snow\n|\u00a0See All (138)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some action and mild rude humor\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nMichael Eisner, then-CEO and Chairman of The Walt Disney Company, was very interested in \"The Snow Queen\" project when it was in early development in 2002. Even though he had much less involvement in production of Disney movies in the 2000s than he had in the 1980s and 90s, he had a special passion for the story and characters of the Snow Queen. Eisner offered his support to the project and even suggested doing the film with John Lasseter at Pixar Animation Studios, when the two studios would get their contracts renewed.

Featuring some bravura performances from an all-star cast including Anne Hathaway (Oscar winner), Hugh Jackman (Oscar nominated), Russell Crowe, Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. Set against the sweeping backdrop of 19th-century France, 'Les Mis' tells an enthralling and emotional story of passion, love and redemption, accompanied by some stunning cinematography, uplifting musical numbers and flawless direction. While it does drag on at parts, 'Les Mis' is generally an impeccably crafted musical to be enjoyed by all.\n\n\n\n\n                91 of 116 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,000 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n Who was General Lamarque?\n\n\nQ:\n What is the significance of the elephant statue?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official YouTube\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUK\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 7 February 2013 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Aluvey he'hayim\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nThe Historic Dockyard Chatham, Chatham, Kent, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$61,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $27,281,735,\n30 December 2012 \n\nGross USA: $148,809,770        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $441,809,770        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Universal Pictures, Working Title Films, Cameron Mackintosh Ltd. \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n158 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| Datasat\n| SDDS\n| Dolby Surround 7.1\n| Dolby Atmos\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When Navy Captain Georg Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) writes to the convent asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. The Captain's wife is dead, and he is often away, and runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring, and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives - including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though Georg is already engaged to a Baroness and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made.

Martin, who originated the role of Maria on Broadway, eventually received nearly $8 million from this movie. In contrast, Dame Julie Andrews earned just $225,000 for her performance.

However, it is obvious from the various scenes that they are singing this song over the course of several days, hence the clothes changes. The children are shown in other clothes while in town or in the house grounds, while wearing the play clothes climbing trees or in the countryside - suggesting they wear them for activities where they may get dirty (so as not to spoil their good clothes). Additionally if it were the same day, it would be strange for Captain Von Trapp to drive all the way to Vienna to meet Elsa and Max and then drive back.

In 1987, an NBC version of the film was aired. This version of the film cut out the following moments - the end of \"I Have Confidence In Me\" is cut, going to commercial right after Maria says \"Oh, help\". Also cut was the part where Captain Von Trapp tells his children at the dinner table he is going to Vienna the next day. It goes from Liesl asking to be excused right to her running out the door towards Rolf. Also cut was the scene where the nuns sing the \"Alleluia\", editing it from the scene in the chapel right to the nun running to tell Mother Abbess that Maria is missing. Another cut includes the Captain and Baroness walking in the hall during the ball. Instead of seeing the children doing the \"cuckoo\" introduction to \"So Long, Farewell\", we see the children beginning the song in a straight line. Finally, the scene where the Captain rips the Nazi Flag is cut, going right to Liesl talking to Maria.

Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music.\n\n\n\n\n                28 of 29 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 519 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Mary Martin originated the role on Broadway; was she considered for the movie?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official Site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGerman\n\n\nRelease Date: 5 September 1965 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: La novicia rebelde\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMehlweg, Marktschellenberg, Bavaria, Germany\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$8,200,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $413,497,\n9 September 2018 \n\nGross USA: $159,287,539        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $159,428,329        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Robert Wise Productions, Argyle Enterprises \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n172 min\n|\n138 min\n            (original German theatrical release)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\n70 mm 6-Track\n(Westrex Recording System)| 4-Track Stereo\n(Westrex Recording System)| DTS\n(re-release)\u00a0(1995)| Dolby Digital\n(re-release)\u00a0(1995)| SDDS\n(re-release)\u00a0(1995)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

This version replicates the scene continuity of the 1930 release version, including about a minute of exit music. A small amount of footage was not found and is covered by still photographs. This is the version that played at the Museum of Modern Art and Film Forum in 2016, and was released by the Criterion Collection on Blu-Ray and DVD in 2018.

I had previously understood that prior to 1935 this was technically or chemically impossible. The two-color Technicolor was not new (Ben-Hur, for example) but it does add richness after you get used to it. Really interesting (to me, at least) to see the VERY young Bing Crosby singing as part of the Rhythm Boys. Whiteman's orchestra does Rhapsody in Blue when it was still a new piece. Comedy acts are corny and quaint. The big production numbers were lavish and very new; some seemed experimental and fresh. They didn't yet know just what to do with a musical-entertainment movie, so they just threw in some of everything that was popular on stage at the time, done by some very talented performers.\n\n\n\n\n                5 of 6 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 41 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

It's California 1958 and greaser Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Australian Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John) are in love. They spend time at the beach, and when they go back to school, what neither of them knows is that they both now attend Rydell High. Danny's the leader of the T-Birds, a group of black leather jacket-wearing greasers while Sandy hangs with the Pink Ladies, a group of pink-wearing girls led by Rizzo (Stockard Channing). When they clash at Rydell's first pep rally, Danny isn't the same Danny from the beach. They try to be like each other so they can be together.\nWritten by\nAlex Schultz <NedSDeclassified2967> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n year 1959\n|\n cheerleader uniform\n|\n high school\n|\n boyfriend girlfriend relationship\n|\n automobile racing\n|\u00a0See All (270)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nGREASE is the word.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nPG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    After the BBC aired the movie in Dec. 2020, viewers complained on social media that the film promoted misogyny, racism and homophobia, according to Britain's The Times. Soon after, co-star Olivia Newton-John said during an interview on the Australian podcast \"A Life of Greatness\" that those who criticize \"Grease\" and say it is sexist and lacking in diversity need to \"relax a little bit\" and called those comments \"kind of silly.\" She added, \"The movie was made in the '70s about the '50s. It's a fun movie musical and not to be taken so seriously. I think everyone is taking everything so seriously. We need to relax a little bit and just enjoy things for what they are.\" Newton-John went on to say she doesn't view \"Grease\" in the way her critics do, and that \"it's just a fun movie that entertains people. That's all.\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nWhen Sandy and Rizzo are talking outside the school, just before Rizzo sings \"There are Worse Things I Could Do,\" Sandy's white and pink hair barrettes switch sides in some shots.

I've just had the best summer of my life, and now I have to go away. It isn't fair.\n[Danny starts kissing her]\nSandy:\nDanny, don't spoil it!\nDanny:\nIt's not spoiling it, Sandy, it's only making it better.\nSandy:\nDanny... is this the end?\nDanny:\nOf course not; it's only the beginning.\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    The beginning credits show the main characters in cartoon form.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\n1998 theatrical re-release featured a heavily remixed soundtrack. Reverb and, in some cases, background vocals were added to many of the songs, and new sound effects were added in certain scenes. All DVD and Blu-ray releases up to 2018 feature only this remix. The 40th Anniversary 4K, Blu-ray, and DVD restoration contain a remix of the original stereo soundtrack, restoring all of the original sound effects and undoing all of the revisions (most notably the background vocals) to the songs from the 20th anniversary version.

You can't fail to like the songs, especially Grease and Summer Nights. The characters will live on forever. I saw a reunion show on TV recently, and you can tell this movie was as much fun to watch as it was to make. A classic in all aspects!\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 12 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 452 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Who is Sandra Dee?\n\n\nQ:\n Was anything from the original musical left out in the movie?\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'Grease' about?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 10 November 1978 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Pom\u00e1da\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\n6th Street Viaduct, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$6,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $8,941,717,\n18 June 1978 \n\nGross USA: $190,071,103        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $396,271,103        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Paramount Pictures, Robert Stigwood Organization (RSO), Allan Carr Production \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n110 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n(re-release)\u00a0(1998)| Dolby Digital\n(re-release)\u00a0(1998)| Dolby\n(35 mm prints)\u00a0(original release)| 70 mm 6-Track\n(70 mm prints)\u00a0(original release)| SDDS\n(re-release)\u00a0(1998)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Metrocolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

'Memory', one of its many classic songs, became an instant worldwide hit. Since then CATS has smashed records and conquered the world. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend has been captured on screen. Breathtaking visuals and full digital sound (that has been completely re-recorded with a seventy piece orchestra) will leave you deep into the mysterious world of CATS as you've never seen it before - more intoxicating and magical than you could possibly imagine. With a star cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n ballet\n|\n aging\n|\n kidnapping\n|\n magician\n|\n thief\n|\u00a0See All (41)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nNow and Forever!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The cast, dancers and singers were drawn together from the various stage productions of the musical.

I love the variety of musical styles in all the songs, the sense of community among all the characters, even those bizarre stylized costumes and make-up. This is a fun musical, all around, and I can see why trying to make it more \"cinematic\" does not suit the material. The 1998 adaptation seems to essentially just shoot the stage show as it is, with a few close-ups and cinematic flourishes for good effect.While I would recommend the 2019 movie for those who love hilariously bad films, the 1998 film is the better choice if you want to see just why CATS made billions of dollars.\n\n\n\n\n                3 of 3 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 101 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The feuding families become two warring New York City gangs--the white Jets led by Riff and the Latino Sharks, led by Bernardo. Their hatred escalates to a point where neither can coexist with any form of understanding. But when Riff's best friend (and former Jet) Tony and Bernardo's younger sister Maria meet at a dance, no one can do anything to stop their love. Maria and Tony begin meeting in secret, planning to run away. Then the Sharks and Jets plan a rumble under the highway--whoever wins gains control of the streets. Maria sends Tony to stop it, hoping it can end the violence. It goes terribly wrong, and before the lovers know what's happened, tragedy strikes and doesn't stop until the climactic and heartbreaking ending.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n virility\n|\n sexuality\n|\n love interest\n|\n girl\n|\n neighborhood\n|\u00a0See All (140)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nUnlike other musicals 'West Side Story' grows younger!(re-release)                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Crime\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Film rights to the play were bought for $375,000.

The background changes color as the themes change throughout the overture. As the overture ends, the tinting is blue, the title appears, and the shot segues to aerial photography of Manhattan streets and landmarks.

The intermission sequence was supposed to have taken place right before the song 'I Feel Pretty' and brings the film's total running time to more than 152 minutes. This break was used, however, for the film's first television showing in 1972 on NBC. It was broadcast in two installments, one each on separate nights, the first part ending at the break, and the second part beginning at the \"I Feel Pretty\" sequence.

An amazing omission on my part, as having seen it, I just think it's simply wonderful.I bought the DVD \"on spec\" in a CD/DVD exchange store in Sydney for $10. I've had it in my hand a couple of times before but have always put it back on the shelf. This time I went through with the purchase and am now wondering what could have come over me, not buying it before.Those here who have said you really need to watch it on the Big Screen are absolutely right. In my case I watched it using a video projector throwing the image, big, bright and beautiful, onto a 12 foot screen. The photography used the wide screen format uncompromisingly. There was no caution here to frame the action for possible television cropping, or even much consideration given to a 2.35:1 \"Cinemascope\" presentation. Super Panavision's aspect ratio is not as wide as Cinemascope's 2.35:1, and every square inch of screen space was used for one or another important element of composition.Bernstein's music is a tour de force. Having watched On The Town only a few days back, it was interesting to contrast the two musicals. On The town is, of course, 15 years or so older than West side Story, but a comparison between the two scores is chalk and cheese. You could tell that Bernstein was holding himself back in On The Town. It wasn't his project. The numbers were almost self-censored. But West side Story was his baby, and it shows.The sheer brilliance of the music, the enchanting daring of it, its raucous atonality coupled with sweetness of melody are awesomely impressive, as show-stopper after show-stopper is thrown onto the screen to continually up the amazement quotient, time after time. I played West Side Story loud, very loud. The surround sound knocked my socks off from the opening aerial ambiance of Manhattan streets to the orchestrations themselves. I remember Bernstein in the documentary about the concert version of West Side Story saying, aside to the camera, after \"Cool, Boy\" was recorded, \"You know, this is pretty good...\" One of the great understatements, even if coming from the music's creator.See this film. Play it loud. Watch it on a big screen if you can. If you do you may, like I did, sit there thrilled, swinging your head from one side of the Super Panavision screen to the other, trying to take in the overwhelming avalanche coming at your eyes, your ears and your heart. It was an almost perfect transfer from film to DVD: color, sharpness, depth. It's been a long while since I've watched a film with a silly grin on my face right through, sometimes gasping at the sheer knock-out brilliance of what film-making can be at its best. West Side Story was one of those times.\n\n\n\n\n                133 of 172 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 421 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n How old were Maria and Tony?\n\n\nQ:\n Is Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" available for reading online?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nSpanish\n\n\nRelease Date: 18 October 1961 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Sippur Ha-Parvarim\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nChurch of Saint Paul the Apostle, Columbus Avenue & West 60th Street, New York City, New York, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$6,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $207,145,\n24 June 2018 \n\nGross USA: $44,055,492        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $44,063,177        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n The Mirisch Corporation, Seven Arts Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n153 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\n4-Track Stereo\n(35 mm magnetic prints)| 70 mm 6-Track\n(Westrex Recording System)\u00a0(70 mm prints)| Mono\n(35 mm optical prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.20 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Following financial problems brought up by the bank representative Judith, he tells his wealthy friend Eddie that he will host a singing competition with a prize of $1,000. But Buster's assistant, Miss Crawly, accidentally appends two extra zeroes, and the promotional fliers showing $100,000 are blown out of Buster's office into the city streets.\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n singing\n|\n theatre\n|\n jukebox musical\n|\n furry\n|\n singing contest\n|\u00a0See All (161)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAuditions begin 2016                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some rude humor and mild peril\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Beat My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) as the highest grossing film to never hit number one at the U.S. box-office.

Moments later, when the helicopter leaves the scene, he plummets and swings himself to safety on the microphone, which now seems to be attached to a hanging cable anchored somewhere quite high in the air (which additionally contradicts the appearance of the mic when Mike first comes out, where the cable rests on the feet of the microphone stand).\nIn fact, if watched carefully, in the shot where the helicopters departing one can see the cable is extending from ground to air and once helicopters leave and upward suction effect vanishes, part of the cable sticks somewhere high and the part Mike is holding hangs down. However, when the song is finished, no cable extending from ground to upper section is shown.

Sing is quite a different animation film since the basic is about singing. Initially did not expect this film to be great, funny or interesting but upon viewing, there was something different in both style and originality with this film.What makes this film work is not only the singing (there are a blend of older songs and newer ones of different genres) but the different type of characters, and how each main animal character is given a backstory and subplot.For a family/children film it works- the comedy is juvenile, the visuals are nice to look at and it sends a positive message. Exceeded expectations, anticipating Sing 2.\n\n\n\n\n                7 of 9 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 291 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Toby does not stop crying and Sarah wishes that her stepbrother be taken by the Goblin King Jareth. Out of the blue, Toby stops crying and when Sarah looks for him in the cradle, she learns that her wish was granted and the Goblin King Jareth has taken him to his castle in the Goblin City in the middle of a labyrinth. Sarah repents and asks Jareth to give Toby back; but the Goblin King tells her that she has to rescue her brother before midnight. Soon Sarah teams up with some allies. Will they rescue Toby in time?\nWritten by\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n rescue\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n labyrinth\n|\n fantasy world\n|\n masquerade party\n|\u00a0See All (271)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA' mazing tale of never-ending fantasy.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    One of the reasons why Hoggle is always making groaning noises between lines was to keep his mouth open as much as possible, so that actress Shari Weiser was able to look out.

Way too good for children. Jim Henson, as ever, is the absolute master of every kind of puppetry known to man or muppet.Particularly adorable is the little punk worm who invites Sarah to \"Come inside and meet the missus\"... very cute. The plot has all the essential elements of a good fairy tale with the added bonus of a heroine who manages to get through all her trials and tribulations without squealing feebly or fainting into the arms of any poxy bloke. David Bowie is wonderfully sexy (despite the fright wig) and his natural humour shines through although his character does a pretty good job of being spiteful and menacing. I get the feeling the he really enjoyed making this film. The soundtrack is excellent and \"As the World Falls Down\" is quite hauntingly beautiful ('though I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that the ballroom sequence in which it was played did slow the action down a little - but it was a visual feast).All in all, a beautiful film with a wonderful cast of creatures and humans. Makes me miss Jim Henson's talents lots but at least we've still got Brian (his son). My friend's three year old now has a crush on the Goblin King (I dread to think how that's gonna shape her life!).\n\n\n\n\n                158 of 198 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 567 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why did the ground open under Sarah even though she got the riddle right?\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"Labyrinth\" based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n Did Sarah choose the right door?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUK\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 27 June 1986 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Laberinto\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWest Wycombe Park, West Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$25,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $3,549,243,\n29 June 1986 \n\nGross USA: $13,723,253        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $13,915,874        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Henson Associates (HA), Lucasfilm, The Jim Henson Company \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n101 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Stereo\n| 70 mm 6-Track\n| Dolby Atmos\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Mother Gothel knows that the flower's magical powers are now growing within the golden hair of Rapunzel, and to stay young, she must lock Rapunzel in her hidden tower. Rapunzel is now a teenager and her hair has grown to a length of 70-feet. The beautiful Rapunzel has been in the tower her entire life, and she is curious of the outside world. One day, the bandit Flynn Ryder scales the tower and is taken captive by Rapunzel. Rapunzel strikes a deal with the charming thief to act as her guide to travel to the place where the floating lights come from that she has seen every year on her birthday. Rapunzel is about to have the most exciting and magnificent journey of her life.\nWritten by\nDouglas Young (the-movie-guy) \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n rapunzel\n|\n based on fairy tale\n|\n disney\n|\n flower\n|\n heroine\n|\u00a0See All (135)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThey're taking adventure to new lengths.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for brief mild violence\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Scored an Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Song with \"I See The Light\", but it didn't get a Nomination for Best Animated Feature.

I didn't know what to expect, it's Disney which is promising, but it's also Disney's first CGI Disney movie that got a PG rating, so it seemed different. It was pretty hard for me to choose between 'Tangled' or 'Burlesque' but I'm glad I made the decision to watch 'Tangled'. This film has everything, for everyone, boys girls and tongue in cheek humor for adults. It's Disney's answer to Shrek, but in a classy way, that doesn't feed off of pop culture. The story of the film is simple. Rapunzel is a princess that has hair that has power to heal and keep people young, but once it's cut, it loses all power. When Rapunzel was just an infant she was kidnapped by an old woman who locked her away in a tower to keep her hair all to herself. Rapunzel grows up thinking that her kidnapper is in fact her mother, and the reason she's locked away is because her 'mother' wants to keep her safe from the hardships of the world. I'd tell you more about the movie but I don't want to ruin it. Let's just say she runs away. Very simple, fairy tale plot.I was kind of saddened that Disney has succumbed to making Princess movies using CGI, but watching this movie I realize that some scenes wouldn't have the power it had, if it were in 2D. The lantern lighting scene, for example, was amazing. It wouldn't have been the same in 2D. The music, was perfect. Enough musical number to keep Disney fans more than satisfied and not enough to where it's overkill. The songs were heartfelt and meaningful, they all served a purpose, it wasn't just a nameless song thrown into the movie. The voice acting, by Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi were amazing. I was a little sketchy about Mandy. I'm a long time fan, but I wasn't sure if she had the right voice to be a Disney Princess. She gave Rapunzel so much life, and innocence, I couldn't think of any other actress who could play her better. Zachary gave Flynn life, and humor, and made him a very likable character. However, the two characters that stole the show were Pascal, the chameleon, and Maximus, the horse. Although these supporting characters have no speaking lines, through actions and emotions, you know exactly what they want to say, and the message comes in loud and clear. This movie has enough action and comedy to keep boys happy and enough emotion, romance and drama to keep the girls happy. There are a few scenes that made me tear a little, well maybe more than a little. Some scenes have so much emotion and depth that it tugs at your heartstrings, and gives you goosebumps, especially the lantern scenes. Disney is testing the waters of their film making with this one. There were many alcohol references and even references about being drunk. There's violence, people getting stabbed, and yes, even blood. Which you never see is Disney movies. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, to everyone. Anyone could enjoy this movie. It's very hard not to like it. With theater prices so high, I suggest you don't spend 10 dollars to watch Cher and Christina, but watch 'Tangled' instead. They don't make movies like this anymore. It's much better than last year's 'Princess and the Frog'. Rapunzel is now in the line-up of classic Disney princess. I cannot stress how amazing this film is. Go out and see it.\n\n\n\n\n                327 of 380 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 516 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What song plays during the end credits?\n\n\nQ:\n Did Pascal murder Mother Gothel?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nGermany\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGerman\n\n\nRelease Date: 25 November 2010 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Plonter\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nNorden, Germany\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$260,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $48,767,052,\n28 November 2010 \n\nGross USA: $200,821,936        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $592,462,816        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Animation Studios, Walt Disney Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n100 min\n|\n100 min\n            (DVD)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| SDDS\n| DTS\n| Dolby Surround 7.1\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Then, as if that weren't enough, her doting father catches her off-guard by making a life-altering announcement, and Fei Fei's whole world comes crashing down around her. Now, determined to prove him wrong, Fei Fei sets out to build a home-made rocket and blast off to the stars.

A young woman about to be married discovers that any one of three men could be her father. She invites all three to the wedding without telling her mother, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), who was once the lead singer of Donna and the Dynamos. In the meantime, Donna has invited her back-up singers, Rosie Mulligan (Dame Julie Walters) and Tanya Wilkinson (Christine Baranski).\nWritten by\njojo.acapulco@gmail.com \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n bride\n|\n jukebox musical\n|\n wedding\n|\n greek island\n|\n mediterranean\n|\u00a0See All (205)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nEine Hochzeit die man nie vergisst.

When they finish Meryl 'asks' the audience if they want an encore. The three ladies are then joined by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard who are similarly attired. Along with Amanda Seyfried and Dominic Cooper, they provide a rendition of \"Waterloo\" as the main credits roll.

By the time I thought I should check it out, the \"biggest film of the year\" had become a sing-a-long classic and I decided to wait for the DVD. Watching it myself I can totally understand why this reaction was forthcoming and it is not really down to the film so much as it is the viewers. See, those that hate it will do so for the same reasons as those that love it. Mamma Mia is a film version of a stage-show but it is not an adaptation in that it has been made into a film so much as it is a stage musical made into a film. What I mean by this clunky sentence is that all the standards of the cheesy musical have been left in \u0096 from \"big\" action, colour and simple dumb cheer.For me personally this doesn't really appeal and nor did I particularly enjoy the film as it did feel all forced smiles and joys, scenes shoe-horned to fit the lyrics and fake fun in the actors and extras. By the end I had pretty much had as much camp fun as I could really stand and was glad it was done. Now others have taken that to mean that the film is rubbish, but it isn't \u0096 it just didn't work for you either. However for what it does Mamma Mia is actually very good because it knows who it is aiming for and what it has to do. Yes this means that it is daft and cheesy but that sort of \"big\" cheerfulness is what the target audience want \u0096 they want to feel elated and lifted even if it isn't real in any form. In that regard the film delivers as it is built on beautiful colours in the sets and costumes and a cast that put their egos to one side and throw themselves into it.This last part is important because to my disinterested eye all the star actors came off looking daft. Streep is certainly not someone I expected to be doing this and to her credit she throws herself into it, showing a camp overacting side I didn't know she had. Likewise Walters, Baranski, Firth, Brosnan and Skarsg\u00e5rd all do much the same \u0096 albeit to varying degrees of success. If you're into it then the \"big\" performances are all part of the fun but if, like me, you're not, then it will be endlessly embarrassing and it will be hard to shake the feeling that I was watching award-winning actors making themselves look and sound like muppets. Of course that is why they are \"good\" in the context of what the film is trying to be and yet at the same time \"bad\" if you are not in the swing of the film.What we are left with then is a film that we have seen plays really well to those that get it but leaves everyone else wondering why on earth people like Streep and Walters would make such nonsense. I personally disliked it but that does not make it a \"bad\" film, only a bad one from my point of view. For what it sets out to do though, it is a winning achievement \u0096 full of cheerful cheese and lots of colour. In fact, it is such a targeted film that you will already know whether you will love it or hate it long before you press play.\n\n\n\n\n                21 of 29 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 778 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why isn't Chiquitita on the soundtrack?\n\n\nQ:\n Do they ever reveal Sophie's dad?\n\n\nQ:\n Who designed Sophie's wedding dress?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Universal\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nUK\n|\nGermany\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGreek\n\n\nRelease Date: 31 July 2008 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Mamma Mia!

The show follows green-skinned star Elphaba from birth to college and through the life-changing events which eventually label her \"wicked,\" introducing spoiled rich girl Glinda, local prince and heartthrob Fiyero and even the Wizard of Oz himself, a troubled man very unlike the one you may remember. As Elphaba, a passionate political activist if there ever was one, fights injustice and seeks to undo the mistakes of the past, dark secrets and personal tragedies shape the history of Oz, paying homage to the classic Wizard of Oz story while simultaneously changing fans' understanding of it forever. A cautionary tale about love, friendship and trust, Wicked effortlessly reveals that there are indeed two sides to every story.\nWritten by\nBroadway.com \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n wicked witch of the west character\n|\n glinda the good character\n|\n wizard of oz character\n|\n origin story\n|\n scarecrow of oz character\n|\u00a0See All (21)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Action\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Amanda Seyfried joked in an interview in April 2021 that she already started preparing for the role of Glinda the Good Witch in this adaptation, even though she hasn't been cast yet. She said she's sent Universal Pictures and director Jon M. Chu a recording of herself singing the hit song \"Popular\" in the hopes that it will secure her position on the cast. As she put it, \"I've been campaigning for Wicked for five years.\" Many fans have already responded saying she would be a terrific addition to the film.

Hercules is raised on Earth and retains his god-like strength, but when he discovers his immortal heritage Zeus tells him that to return to Mount Olympus he must become a true hero. Hercules becomes a famous hero with the help of his friend Pegasus and his personal trainer, Phil the satyr. Hercules battles monsters, Hades and the Titans, but it is his self-sacrifice to rescue his love Meg which makes him a true hero.\nWritten by\nKristi Connolly <kristic@nlc.net.au> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n hercules\n|\n olympus\n|\n satyr\n|\n hero\n|\n titan\n|\u00a0See All (162)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA Comedy of Epic Proportions                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The role of Pain was written with Bobcat Goldthwait in mind, although the actor confessed he still had to audition for the role despite playing himself.

The animation is more like the \"old-school\" Disney, before the cute, big-eye syndrome and the characters are hugely entertaining. It has sly humour and in-jokes, but what sets it apart are the songs; soul, RNB, jazz and not a drippy sugar-song in sight. Quality entertainment!\n\n\n\n\n                69 of 88 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 235 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Wouldn't Pain and Panic's force-feeding of the potion hurt Hercules?

They learn the Archdiocese will stop supporting the school and will sell the place to the Education Authority. The only way to keep the place open is if the $5000 tax on the property is paid within 11 days. The Blues Brothers want to help, and decide to put their blues band back together and raise the money by staging a big gig. As they set off on their \"mission from God\" they seem to make more enemies along the way. Will they manage to come up with the money in time?\nWritten by\nSami Al-Taher <staher2000@yahoo.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n pig\n|\n on the run\n|\n release from prison\n|\n reckless driving\n|\n police chase\n|\u00a0See All (324)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThey'll never get caught.

The film crew got permission to clear the street for two 100+ mph passes. Stunt pedestrians were added after the first pass, to add realism.

See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nThe film was originally intended to be an old-fashioned roadshow attraction. The original cut of the film had an intermission and may have run as long as three hours. Landis was asked to cut the film after premiering a lengthy director's cut (of an answer print) at the Picwood Theatre in West Los Angeles. That version has been lost. Landis originally tried to restore the original cut several years ago, but found that Universal had thrown out all the outs, trims, negatives, and mix tracks. Landis and George Folsey Jr. restored 18 minutes from another preview print on an AVID for the Collectors' Edition, and correctly timed the picture so that Stephen Katz's photography looks as it was intended to look.

Fantastic Blues/Rock/Jazz/Swing... very nice stuff... John Belushi Rules... this is my all time favorite movie EVER! From the one-liners to the music to the performances to the dialog... everything about it was just so witty, original, unique, intelligent, superb, hilarious... if only more (or dare I say... less) SNL Spin-Off Film Characters were in TRULY ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE... the world would be a much better place in my opinion!

This corrected the issues regarding the three Technicolor strips becoming misaligned during the 1998 restoration and also presented the film in its best quality to date.

When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I'll bet my eyes just popped.This is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network.  In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television.  It was \"Oz.\"  Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does.  What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn't been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, \"Put 'em up, put 'em uuuuup!\"Few musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps \"The Sound of Music.\"  Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, \"The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!\"  Yikes!  In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.I can't say that \"Oz\" doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies.  It's just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings.  The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible.  And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action.  Certain numbers like \"Merry Old Land of Oz,\" I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.Oz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves.  I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard's palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, \"Step forward, Tin Man!\"  What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result?  \"Oz\" is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.The early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light.  This was done due to the lack of a suitable \"color film\" in 1939.  That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives.  Because \"Oz\" was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded.  So now we have home videos/DVDs of breathtaking color quality.  Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr.  But they all hold up amazingly well.\"Oz\" has a valuable message.  As the pop group America once said, \"No, Oz never did give nothin' to the Tin Man....that he didn't, didn't already have.\"  If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion's courage--what we think we most lack.  The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.I feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can't treasure this film experience. They need to visit the Emerald City to get their own ticking Testimonials and find their hearts.Didn't bring your broomsticks with you?  Well, I'm afraid you'll have to walk.\n\n\n\n\n                137 of 163 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 734 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n How was the shift from black and white to color accomplished?\n\n\nQ:\n In the Tin Man sequence, can we see a stagehand on the set; or an actor hanging himself; or someone falling out of a tree?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Warner Bros.

Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder. A member of hard-rock royalty, Queen Barb, aided by her father King Thrash, wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends, set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who's looking to upstage them all.\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n jukebox musical\n|\n second part\n|\n troll doll\n|\n troll\n|\n based on toy\n|\u00a0See All (24)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nHappiest.

Our ancestors thought we were just too different to get along. It turns out they were wrong. Very, very wrong.\nScrapbook Troll:\nWe're sorry!\nPoppy:\nYou have to be able to listen to other voices, even when they don't agree with you. They make us stronger, more creative, more inspired. So whether your song is sad and heartfelt, loud and defiant, or warm and funky, or even if you're a little bit of each, it's all these sounds and all our differences that make our world a richer place. ...\n\nSee more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    The DreamWorks Animation logo turns into a scrapbook page, and the fisher boy gets a Rock Troll makeover and plays a riff on his guitar.

It'd be awfully boring to look and sound the same. Just like it was said in the movie 'if we all look the same, act the same and dress the same, how would anyone know we cool?

However, a melodious voice that only Elsa can hear keeps her awake, inviting her to the mystical enchanted forest that the sisters' father told them about a long time ago. Now, unable to block the thrilling call of the secret siren, Elsa, along with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf, and Sven summons up the courage to follow the voice into the unknown, intent on finding answers in the perpetually misty realm in the woods. More and more, an inexplicable imbalance is hurting not only her kingdom but also the neighboring tribe of Northuldra. Can Queen Elsa put her legendary magical skills to good use to restore peace and stability?\nWritten by\nNick Riganas \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n autumn\n|\n anthropomorphic snowman\n|\n magic\n|\n princess\n|\n salamander\n|\u00a0See All (117)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nFind your strength.

There's lot more going on happening in the movie and it's just 1hour 50 mins long, so a lot of arcs are very rushed and convenient. There are scenea where one character tells the other that this is what they have to do, to get something, with no explanation or reasons. There's lot of, I mean lots of, exposition. Characters tell the stories, tell something they just know or feel and flashbacks or hallucinations kind-of stuff.But this is a movie aimed to kids, and it's okay if the story wasn't technically sound. But for adults, this movie might be too silly at times.About the songs, this time expectations were high, and I didn't like a single song from movie. There were times when I felt they just ripped off their own song from previous movie, let it go. Like last time, no song connected emotiolly with the character, but they're well performed.Kudos to animation team, voice actors, art-designers.\nNot so much for writers and screen play writers.\n\n\n\n\n                371 of 566 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,366 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Knowing that he would never survive the rigours of war in his state, she decides to disguise herself and join in his place. Unknown to her, her ancestors are aware of this and to prevent it, they order a tiny disgraced dragon, Mushu to join her in order to force her to abandon her plan. He agrees, but when he meets Mulan, he learns that she cannot be dissuaded and so decides to help her in the perilous times ahead.\nWritten by\nKenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n woman disguised as a man\n|\n cartoon violence\n|\n war violence\n|\n violence\n|\n girl disguised as boy\n|\u00a0See All (164)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nOn June 19th Feel the Courage Feel the Glory and Feel The Power                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n War\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    This is the only Disney animated film to use the phrase \"cross-dresser.\" The film was almost rated PG because of the use of the phrase.

As this violates UK censorship laws, it was withdrawn after being on sale for around a week. The re-release, due a few months later, will probably be distinguished by having no European soundtrack/subtitle options.

One is that I love the fact that Disney is exploring legends from other cultures and I am so glad it brought us this one.  The other is that I just wanted to stand up and cheer at this great heroine.  I am a huge fan of Disney movies, but most of the heroines, while spunky, are still just your basic damsel in distress.  I loved Mulan's character.  She was strong, she was powerful, she could do anything she wanted, and she overcame much diversity.  I was thrilled to see the portrayal of a strong female character surviving because of her own integrity and strength rather than because of her looks.  Bravo, Disney, for bringing us this wonderfully progressive Chinese tale.\n\n\n\n\n                90 of 102 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 364 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'Mulan' about?\n\n\nQ:\n Is 'Mulan' based on a book?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Offical Disney Site\n    \n|\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nChina\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nMandarin\n\n\nRelease Date: 19 June 1998 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Mulan\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$90,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $22,745,143,\n21 June 1998 \n\nGross USA: $120,620,254        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $304,320,254        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Animation Studios, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, Walt Disney Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n88 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n(Digital DTS Sound)| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And nowhere is the thrill of the underworld more alive than at the Moulin Rouge, a night club where the rich and poor men alike come to be entertained by the dancers, but things take a wicked turn for Christian as he starts a deadly love affair with the star courtesan of the club, Satine. But her affections are also coveted by the club's patron: the Duke. A dangerous love triangle ensues as Satine and Christian attempt to fight all odds to stay together but a force that not even love can conquer is taking its toll on Satine...\nWritten by\nO.G. \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n belle epoque\n|\n tragic ending\n|\n jealousy\n|\n jukebox musical\n|\n two suitors\n|\u00a0See All (119)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nHe entered in a world where fantasies are real.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for sexual content\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor wore harnesses for the scenes on the elephant as they were standing 60ft off the ground.

Moulin Rouge stands alone. I really love this movie.Nicole Kidman did sorta over act in parts (the Elephant scene, and when she tells Zidler she wants to leave.), but other than that, the acting is wonderful. I just love Ewan McGregor's character, and I love Ewan McGregor. John Leguizamo's character, Henri Toulouse Lautrec (yes, the famous painter), I found was just such an annoyingly funny character, he was definently one of my favorite characters. The Duke (Richard Roxburgh) is definently overacted, and frankly, Zidler (John Broadbent), is sooooo horribly annoying, you really would want to throw yourself off the Moulin Rouge windmill.I love this movie. There are some funny parts, but they are mostly just in the beginning, and the best musical number isn't 'Diamonds', but rather, the dramatic 'Roxanne'. Another one of my favourite pieces is 'Nature Boy', the song sung at the very beginning. It's so sad, but very touching.The beginning is sort of depressing, but it doesn't last long, so don't stop the DVD then. The middle sort of drags on, so be warned. The sets and costumes are beautiful, and very colourful, and the dancing is really Spectacular Spectacular (excuse the pun...), but long periods of time with the Bohemians, or at the Moulin Rouge can make you feel like you're stuck in a circus tent. But since Ewan McGregor's in it, I give it 10 stars.\n\n\n\n\n                18 of 23 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 2,372 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"Moulin Rouge!\" based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n Are Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor doing their own singing?\n\n\nQ:\n What exactly is Consumption?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nAustralia\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n|\nSpanish\n\n\nRelease Date: 20 September 2001 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Moulin Rouge\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nFox Studios, Moore Park, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$50,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $167,540,\n20 May 2001 \n\nGross USA: $57,386,607        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $184,935,320        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Twentieth Century Fox, Bazmark Films \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n127 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n|  Black and White\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Naive Sherrie Christian has just arrived in Hollywood from Tulsa looking to become a rock star. She is just like Drew Boley was when he first arrived in Hollywood, he, now the Hollywood veteran, who works as a bar back at the Bourbon Club, known as the center of the rock scene in town and the place where many of the biggest acts in rock got their big break. The two meet as Drew helps Sherrie with a situation when she first arrives in town. Despite Dennis Dupree, the Bourbon's owner/manager, not liking to hire people like Drew or Sherrie - someone who has musical aspirations - as service staff, Drew is able to convince Dennis and his assistant Lonny to hire Sherrie as a server, Drew and Sherrie who have a blossoming mutual attraction. Dennis and Lonny, who are having financial difficulties, are able to convince rock star Stacee Jaxx, the perpetually stoned front man for the band Arsenal who got his first break performing at the Bourbon, to perform for free at a benefit concert at...\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n rock\n|\n concert\n|\n pole dancer\n|\n panties\n|\n music industry\n|\u00a0See All (83)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nNothin' but a good time.        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for sexual content, suggestive dancing, some heavy drinking, and language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    When Justice (Mary J.

Within the movie's \"musical\" illusion of reality, these songs are meant to be representative of the mid-1980s-through-early-1990s era as a whole, since this film is a nostalgic fantasy representation of the era rather than a historically accurate recreation of a specific year. Keep in mind also that an important plot element is the notion that the song \"Don't Stop Believin'\" is written in 1987 by the fictitious Drew Boley, but in real life was written by Journey in 1981, and was already a well known song by 1987.

Well let me just say that I am not a fan for musical movies, but I give credit where credit is due and I was glad I watched this movie. The song list they had chosen to sing in this movie went along with the storyline and flowed throughout the movie. As for the singing, well it was spot on and delightful to listen to. Had me singing a lot of the songs with them. Each character was playing such a big role with the almost ensemble cast it seemed. Tom Cruise crushed it as the Rock Legend Stacee Jaxx it was very intriguing to see what his character would do throughout the movie. Julianne Hough was stunningly beautiful in every scene and her singing was nice as well, but it seemed she could use some better acting. Mary J. Blige was good in her role and really brought good quality to her character in the film that it made her star for her sort of little camera time. Overall I would recommend musical lovers and non-musical lovers to watch this for good entertainment and great music.\n\n\n\n\n                21 of 33 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 422 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is this film based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Extended Cut?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 2 August 2012 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: La era del rock\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMiami, Florida, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$75,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $14,437,269,\n17 June 2012 \n\nGross USA: $38,518,613        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $59,418,613        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n New Line Cinema, Corner Store Entertainment, Material Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n123 min\n|\n136 min\n            (Extended Version)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| Datasat\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It must be saidl, also, that it is an amazing film from different points of view and an \"episodic\" film is always a challenge and the Coens win it all. The acting is excellent, the direction too, spectacular environments and everything is of a unique versatility so as to seem to be in a theater. In conclusion: once again the Coens sign a very interesting film.\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 13 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 742 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Are the various stories original or adapted?\n\n\nQ:\n Who plays the landlady in the first scene of \"The Gal Who Got Rattled\"?\n\n\nQ:\n Billy Knapp asks Alice if her brother Gilbert is a \"doughface\".

On one of her visits to the surface, which are forbidden by her controlling father, King Triton, she falls for a human prince. Determined to be with her new love, Ariel makes a dangerous deal with the sea witch Ursula to become human for three days.

It tells the classic Hans Christian Anderson story of a mermaid who wishes she could be human in order to capture the love of a human prince. The animation is beautiful, in fact I think this is one of Disney's most flawless films. It features lovable characters: Ariel the little mermaid is one of my favorite 'Disney girls', Sebastian the crab, Scuttle the wacky seagull, Flounder the... flounder, Triton Ariel's father the Sea King and of course prince charming- Eric. And don't think I forgot the most despised octopus of the oceans- Ursula and her two eels Flotsam and Jetsum. Great beginning and great ending... and of course a lovable story. The music is beautiful (and rightfully won the Oscar for best score and best song). The score is by Alan Menken (who also provided us with the scores of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast). Some of the most beautiful Disney songs are in The Little Mermaid- Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl and for a little bit of dancin' Under the Sea. A movie for all ages, you will be enchanted by Ariel's world under the sea, by the wacky characters, the cruel but in a strange way lovable Ursula, the score, the songs, the story and the animation. I hope everybody has The Little Mermaid in their video collection to one day show their children and grandchildren or any youngster (or adult for that matter). You will be captured by Ariel and want to be part of her (most intriguing) world.\n\n\n\n\n                44 of 53 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 298 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is 'The Little Mermaid' based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n When Ursula turns Ariel into a human, isn't she naked?\n\n\nQ:\n Can I read the original fairytale online?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 6 July 1990 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: But Ha-Yum Ha-Ktana\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

What is seen in this movie is just \"cherry-picked bits of it\". During that scene, the male cast members competed to see who could stuff the most down their spandex trousers.

In this movie her father was never in the picture and it is implied that her mom got pregnant with her after a one night stand.

The acting & writing were spot on and you honestly care about these characters and want to see them happy. The music is so much fun and every single song makes you feel something....happy, sad, inspired... This ensemble are so talented and the premise is really cute. I really hope there is another season. I just finished watching the entire season and I honestly can say that I'm fighting putting it on again. Bravo to all involved. Wardrobe, lighting, writing, audio, acting, set design (and others), you all did a fantastic job.\n\n\n\n\n                42 of 47 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 277 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

In 2004, for the 40th Anniversary DVD, this was replaced with the Walt Disney Pictures logo. The same thing has been done with the other old Disney films ever since the studio changed its name from Walt Disney Productions to Walt Disney Pictures. The Buena Vista logo was restored for the 2013 Blu-ray release.

It's a light-hearted comedy and a delightful movie that is so much fun to watch. The movie looks dated for today's standards, but it is undeniably charming. In fact, its old-fashioned charm is timeless. It's a good movie and a classic, so the fact that it looks dated is not a major problem.It's easy to understand why \"Mary Poppins\" is such a beloved classic: its simplicity, its magic, its special/visual effects, its beautiful songs, its good morals, its charm, its characters, its classic humor, its combination of live-action and animation and great actors. The way how this combines live-action and animation is very good. Amazing for its time and keeps working out fine.The sceneries and landscapes of London city are stunning when Mary Poppins is floating on the air (angles of view never seen before or after this, not even in Peter Pan's movies). The walks through London's streets also allows us to know this beautiful city better, as well as its monuments and respective wonderful architecture. The landscapes through the roofs of London are simply amazing and the dancing numbers are excellent.\u00abSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious\u00bb is the longest and strangest word I've ever heard. Definitely a nonsense but charming word. In fact, I had to practice this word for about a month. Now I can say it easily, but I had serious difficulties to say this word at first.\"Mary Poppins\" is an amusing and magical tale, with some valuable morals about family, education and stuff like that as well, combined with light humor.The characters are interesting in general. Bert is a very cool guy which a cheerful personality, a fine artist, an excellent dancer and speaks with a cockney accent. Dick Van Dyke is awesome as Bert and the way he dances is incredible. He was in excellent shape here. He really dances like Ray Bolger.The Banks children (Jane and Michael) are absolutely adorable. They're both sweet, innocent and so cute. Michael Banks is the funniest of the two, with his goofy faces in an adorable way and his hilarious way of being \u00abextremely stubborn and suspicious\u00bb. And they're portrayed by two of the most charismatic and talented child actors of all time: Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber. It's really sad that Matthew Garber went to Heaven so young (at the age of 21).Mary Poppins is \u00abthe perfect nanny\u00bb. A magical woman who is also firm and serious but kind and cheerful. Great performance by Julie Andrews, one of her very best. Winifred Banks is a lovable mother, greatly portrayed by Glynis Johns. George Banks is a workaholic, impatient, cold and very serious father most of the time, but at the end of the movie he changes radically his attitudes and becomes a jolly and lovable father. Good performance by David Tomlinson.Uncle Albert is a character with a minor role but a strong presence. He's very jolly, maybe a little too much, but he's simply hilarious. Ed Wynn is awesome and hilarious as Uncle Albert, a role that resembles somehow the Mad Hatter from \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951) - a funny coincidence, because he was the voice of the Mad Hatter. I admit that at first the whole \"I Love to Laugh\" sequence was a little too much for me, but I quickly got used to it and ended up finding it great fun.The soundtrack is gold. There are so many lovely songs that it's difficult to chose a favorite. I have many favorites: \"The Perfect Nanny\", \"Let's go fly a kite\", \"Stay Awake\", \"The Carousel Horses\", \"A Spoonful of Sugar\", \"Feed the Birds (Tuppence a Bag)\", \"Jolly Holliday\", \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", \"Sister Suffragette\", \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" and \"Penguin Dance\". On the other hand, \"A Man Has Dreams\", \"Step in Time\" and \"The Life I Lead\" are nice too, but my favorites are definitely the ones I listed first. The only song I don't like very much is \"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\". The only part I like in that song is \u00abYou'll see, Michael, you'll be part of railways through Africa, dams across the Nile, fleets of ocean greyhounds, majestic, self-amortizing canals, plantations of ripening sea\u00bb.Oh, I love the merry-go-round and the carousel horses of this movie. They're all beautiful. The merry-go-round has a very nostalgic effect for me - it reminds me about childhood. The merry-go-round was so much fun to be in. I also like the animated characters, especially the penguins and the fox.\n\n\n\n\n                35 of 49 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 345 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Not only is Into The Woods one of my favorite musicals, but Rob Marshall was the director who brought Kander & Ebb's Chicago to the big screen in 2002 \u2013 an effort which resulted in the first musical to win the Best Picture Oscar since 1968! In fact, since Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge update in 2001, several major musicals have been successfully adapted to the big screen \u2013 including Chicago, Dreamgirls, and the unfairly criticized Les Miserables just two years ago.I hate to say it, but Into The Woods does not fall into this category. I found the film dreary, draggy, and quite frankly, boring. How can this be? It's the same dialogue, the same music, the same set, and the same costumes as we see on stage. But therein lay the problem. On stage, set designers create \"the woods,\" and the actors move in and out of these woods. We use our imagination to pretend the woods are larger than what we see on stage. Here, the woods are huge. After all, these are the movies. Unfortunately, the woods all look the same. Marshall may as well have filmed a stage performance. Furthermore, the sky is always cloudy, giving the picture a dirty, dingy feel.Into these woods, several classic stories interconnect, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack & The Beanstalk, and Rapunzel. Tying all the stories together is the story of a baker and his wife, who are unable to conceive a child due to a curse placed on them by the witch who lives next door. On stage, characters from the various fairy tales bump into one another in hilarious fashion, and eventually all the loose ends are wrapped up and most of the characters live happily ever after.But the film has one major flaw, and that is that the loose ends are tied up too soon. The sun finally shines on Cinderella's wedding day, as all the townsfolk join the celebration. I looked at my watch and realized we were only an hour Into The Woods, causing me to wonder what director Rob Marshall was going to do with the rest of the movie. On stage, Cinderella's wedding is merely a formality \u2013 a necessary conclusion to the story we all know, but certainly not the end of the musical. Here, Marshall gives the wedding scene such heft \u2013 and differentiates it from the previous hour's worth of material \u2013 that we feel like it's time to get up and leave.At this point, the film version goes awry. The players begin behaving out of character for reasons never explained. For instance, how could the handsome prince consider Cinderella the love of his life one day, and then cheat on her the next? Why does Jack's mother die? (Her death is one of the funniest scenes on stage. Here, it happens so quickly, I wasn't even sure if she had died or not. And Jack's demeanor doesn't change one iota.) Another problem is Stephen Sondheim himself. You see, Sondheim is a lyricist. When he wrote the lyrics for Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story, the result was one of the best stage and screen musicals of all time. But when Sondheim writes his own melodies, the result is often wordy, tuneless ditties you won't remember two minutes after leaving the theatre. Again, on stage this is no big deal. In fact, it almost accentuates the material to feature the characters speaking and singing in similar speech patterns. But on screen, I had that, \"Not another song!\" feeling all through the third act \u2013 the way I did with Barbra Streisand's Yentl back in 1983.I certainly can't knock the performances, although Anna Kendrick's remarkable turn as Cinderella is the only one that stands out from the rest. Her character seems genuine, and she gives Cinderella a few new dimensions, rather than simply fulfilling the role we think we know from the fairy tale. Three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep has been nominated for another Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the witch. She's fine, but she won't win. I could name at least a dozen Streep performances better than this one.It's a disappointment to me that Into The Woods didn't adapt better to the big screen. That makes three films this season that I really wanted to like, and was disappointed at the outcome \u2013 Birdman, Inherent Vice, and now Into The Woods. Throughout the course of motion picture history, it often seems as though the best musicals are those written directly for the screen, such as Singin' In The Rain or Mary Poppins. Adapting material from another source is always risky. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. As I've thought more about Into The Woods, I wonder if this isn't one of those musicals that simply wasn't meant to adapt to the screen. Remember Richard Attenborough's inexcusable A Chorus Line? That's another great, intimate show that simply doesn't work on the large easel of the motion picture screen. I fear that's what we have here with Into The Woods.\n\n\n\n\n                18 of 28 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 924 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Who is the narrator?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 19 February 2015 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: El tokh ha'ya'ar\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nShepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$50,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $31,051,923,\n28 December 2014 \n\nGross USA: $128,002,372        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $212,902,372        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n BBL Motion Picture Studios, Lucamar Productions, Marc Platt Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n125 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDatasat\n| Dolby Digital\n| Dolby Atmos\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The plot may be clich\u00e9d to a point, but the characters are pretty likable and the overall atmosphere is fun. Kristen Chenoweth is delightful as Maleficent, and even adds a couple of nods to Glinda, something which other Wicked fans are sure to pick up on. Unlike some family comedies, this one doesn't rely on crude humor to be funny and instead remains appropriate for all ages. Disney fans will enjoy the little tributes to some of the classics. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for some light, musical entertainment. I'm looking forward to the sequel!\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 18 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 98 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Instead, the couple will inadvertently unearth the cross-dressing Dr. Frank-N-Furter's (Tim Curry's) spooky lair of inexhaustible oddities, just in time to partake in the out-of-this-world mad scientist's proud unveiling of his latest, delightfully extravagant, most daring creation: the ultimate male and the perfect sex symbol: the flaxen-haired Rocky Horror (Peter Hinwood). But, little by little, as the effervescent transgressive force gobbles up whole the unsuspecting visitors of the night, Brad and Janet slowly begin to embrace the potent fascinations of seduction, while an idolized Rocky roams free in the mansion.

All of the pink room scenes were shot, then the set torn down so they could do the swimming pool scenes. After all of the pink tile was smashed, and the set destroyed, part of a wall had to be re-created for one of Tim Curry's scenes.

Shocked by this strange new environment that doesn't operate on a \"happily ever after\" basis, Giselle is now adrift in a chaotic world badly in need of enchantment. But when Giselle begins to fall in love with a charmingly flawed divorce lawyer who has come to her aid - even though she is already promised to a perfect fairy tale Prince back home - she has to wonder: Can a storybook view of romance survive in the real world?\nWritten by\nOrange \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n fairy tale\n|\n new york\n|\n new york city\n|\n love\n|\n prince\n|\u00a0See All (156)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe real world and the animated world collide.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some scary images and mild innuendo\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Enchanted was the film that made Amy Adams a household name.

In the first fourteen minutes of Enchanted, there were two things that caught my attention: 1)The never-ending, sugar-coated, sing-along tune and 2) The grainy style of animation that Disney lavished upon the screen(a tribute to the Disney classics, such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty); in this time span, I felt truly embarrassed to be sitting in the theater with the older couples clustered around me. I mean, what kind of boy in his right mind would want to watch a movie with musical numbers and pretty princesses? And yet, there was something about it...the aire of it almost took me back to the days of my childhood when I would smash my face up to the T.V. screen, when Belle and the Beast were having their unforgettable ball dance or when Ariel was brushing her hair with a fork. It was these sorts of memories that surfaced to my mind as I kept watching Enchanted. And it kept getting better and better. When there was a sudden switch to live-action, my heart was captured by Amy Adams, who seems to be, in my opinion, the finest choice for Giselle. Prince Edward and Robert also had their perfect fits (James Marsden and Patrick Dempsey). Even though this movie is close to perfect, it still has its problems. There is an aire of predictability in the storyline, as well as the fact that it's swamped with clich\u00e9s (some of which are fresh, and some of which are flat). Yet it flows on, innocently, with its strong actors/actresses, decent-enough screenplay that gives you a warm feeling in your heart (which is what Disney is supposed to do, right?), spectacular music numbers that have charm, and the fact that it is suitable for all ages. There is a little something for everyone in this film--and it's not just a film either--it is a time-machine back to the golden era of Disney's animated films, and its live-action ones as well. And it helps me look forward to the new Disney: one that keeps surprising me more and more every single day.\n\n\n\n\n                180 of 198 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 430 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n I thought I heard that Idina Menzel had a song written for her for this movie.

Nobody wants the prize more than young Charlie, but as his family is so poor that buying even one bar of chocolate is a treat, buying enough bars to find one of the five golden tickets is unlikely in the extreme. But in movieland, magic can happen. Charlie, along with four somewhat odious other children, get the chance of a lifetime and a tour of the factory. Along the way, mild disasters befall each of the odious children, but can Charlie beat the odds and grab the brass ring?\nWritten by\nRick Munoz <rick.munoz@his.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n factory\n|\n chocolate\n|\n ticket\n|\n candy\n|\n golden ticket\n|\u00a0See All (183)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nCharlie is let loose in the chocolate factory and every kid's dream comes true.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    PRODUCT PLACEMENT: During the grand opening scene before Wonka makes his public appearance and opens the gate for the ticket winners, a vendor walks by with Coca-Cola branded on the box.

There's no denying that the book is sheer genius, but in all honesty this film adaptation is exceptionally well made too. In fact, it comes high up on my list of all-time movie favourites.The Wonka Chocolate Factory is an amazing building from which some of the most scrumdiddlyumptious sweets are delivered to the world's candy stores. Wonka-mania hits the world when five golden tickets are hidden inside packs of Wonka bars - for the winners will be granted a tour of the top-secret factory. Young Charlie Bucket, a poor boy whose family cottage lies within sight of Wonka's factory, dreams of becoming a winner - but with barely a penny to his name, does he have a chance?What makes Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory such a success is the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral. Each winning child is exposed as being rotten-to-the-core, then dealt with harshly and dismissively by Wonka. Seeing these awful brats get their come-uppance is hilarious, enjoyable and - on a serious level - quite eye-opening (it's as if parents in the audience are being told how to prevent their children from turning bad). Gene Wilder was simply born to play Wonka (every eccentric phrase, every bemused expression, and every mischievous glance is judged to perfection). The film's set design is fabulous, with particular high-spots including the chocolate room, the egg room and the wacky corridor which gets smaller and narrower the closer you get to the end. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is simply magic - a film that everyone must see, especially parents whose kids are just becoming that bit too big for their boots!\n\n\n\n\n                142 of 166 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 429 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n While traveling through the tunnel, what were the images that appeared and scared everyone?\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n What are the quoted passages that Willy Wonka recites?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Warner Bros.

Seriously, what other show features songs that rhyme 'didactic' with 'anti-climactic', uses the Freudian model for the human mind as a key story device, tosses in movie references, artistic motifs and literary allusions obscure enough to challenge a film scholar, sneaks in a psychedelic drug trip or two thanks to some toxic moss, and then cuts away to its secondary plot arc in a secret world where everybody's pet is a government crime fighter? Did I mention that every song cleverly parodies a different genre, style, period or artist, or that each secondary crime fighting plot intrudes momentarily on the main story line at just the right spot in each episode to wreak the most havoc? Though the show's target audience likely catches little of this, they no doubt appreciate the creative richness that informs it all. And most importantly, the show's popularity proves that they find it all FUN.Instead of dumbing down recycled versions of older entertainment forms, such as the sitcom, to make it 'age-appropriate' for pre-teens, the creative team behind P&F have created a true original, loaded with enough wit and charm to satisfy Noel Coward, and enough science fiction outrageousness to satisfy a Doctor Who fan. Every show carries the same upbeat message to seize every opportunity for adventure, because it might not come again, while never condescending to its viewers or getting preachy. There is a lot of truly awful kids' programming out there. It's great to see something which genuinely transcends the perceived boundaries of what a kids' show should be and goes out and demonstrates what it CAN be.\n\n\n\n\n                43 of 47 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 107 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Where is Danville located?\n\n\nQ:\n How are Phineas and Ferb related?\n\n\nQ:\n Who is Phineas and Candace's biological father?

I eagerly awaited the DVD, and when I first sat down to watch it, I didn't finish it. I guess I just wasn't in the mood. I began to wonder what all the hoopla was about. Now, a couple of weeks later, I watched it from the beginning and now I \"get\" it. I must have been in a different mood, because this time everything \"clicked\" for me, it was great fun, simply a very entertaining movie. Now I'm glad I own the DVD, aside from my desire to have as many Oscar winners as I can. The whole story is a parody of fame, crime, and use of a slick lawyer to fool a jury. I will enjoy watching it again and again.My favorite scene was where Gere's lawyer was puppetteer to Zellweger's Roxie, the acting, the singing, the timing were all just perfect. It has been well-publicized that Zellweger neither sang nor danced professionally before \"Chicago\", and I found her more than adequate for the role of Roxie. In fact, I quite enjoy her singing voice. Yet, Catherine Z-J has the more powerful, trained voice, having started out on stage, and it is apparent when they are together that Z-J is the more seasoned performer. I was very pleasantly surprised at how well Gere handled his singing duties. Some have complained about his somewhat \"nasal\" singing voice, but to me it fit his character well. A rich, operatic baritone would have been out of character.I viewed the DVD with the DTS track selected and it delivers with a fine surround sound. Plus, the picture is very sharp, in all a good DVD to own for fans of musical comedies.\n\n\n\n\n                52 of 84 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,044 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Was Roxie really pregnant?\n\n\nQ:\n Was the ending real?

But she has always suffered from anxiety and depression, for which she is on a plethora of pills. Those maladies are largely from being pushed by her overbearing Jewish mother, which also led to Rebecca's father abandoning the family when she was young. When on the streets of New York Rebecca runs into Josh Chan, her boyfriend from summer camp ten years ago when they were sixteen, she remembers back to that time as the happiest time in her life, happiness which eludes her. When Josh mentions that he is imminently moving back to his hometown of West Covina, California, Rebecca decides to pursue happiness in moving to West Covina herself, telling people it's because she got a fabulous job there, where in reality it's to rekindle a relationship with Josh, which she believes is what will make ...\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n law firm\n|\n west covina california\n|\n female lawyer\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n obsession\n|\u00a0See All (46)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nI can fix this.

Yes, it has some (well done, IMHO) musical numbers. If this makes your eyes roll back in your head, then nothing else that anyone says will probably make much difference to you. Is it different? Yeah, sure it is. As someone else already proclaimed, it is \"refreshing\". With so many other \"attempts\" at comedy programming, which simply retread the same formula (ad infinitum), it's enjoyable to see someone do something completely different. I also thought that the premise of the show was clever, as well, and thought that the initial musical presentation of that \"plot\" enhanced it, instead of detracting. (It pretty much \"enhanced\" and legitimized, the craziness of it all, which I assume to have been 100% intentional.) As I'm only one episode in, it's hard to know how the writing will hold up. I'm far more concerned about the fact that (in most parts of the country) it's head to head, with three, double-digit ratings, \"big network\" programs. That may say more about its ability to survive, than future scripts, musical numbers, or anything else. It feels a lot like the CW has simply offered it up (from the get-go) as nothing more than a sacrificial lamb. In fact, it's probably the absolute worst possible time slot, in that it's up against two reality shows, one involving singing, and the other dancing. If there's an audience that might have actually been \"the most likely to enjoy\" a comedy that folds in full (singing and dancing) musical numbers, it's probably the folks that are already invested in two of those three double-digit (ratings) programs! Anyway, if you are interested in trying a \"different comedy flavor\", at least give this a try.\n\n\n\n\n                64 of 86 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 124 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Growing up the best of friends, they share a strong bond of free-spirited youth and good-natured rivalry.

I loved Mulan, I loved Anastasia even more, and now... Well, I must say that Prince of Egypt is probably the best of all. I'd even say, the best animation feature ever produced in the USA (aside from Batman : Mask of the Phantasm).It is a real piece of art, aiming to entertain everybody, not only act as a baby-sitter movie for kids. There aren't even any pets here. Only a great story, moving scenes, credible characters and fantastic music and storyboard. You will love this one.\n\n\n\n\n                150 of 195 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 436 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is the song in Hebrew that the child sings at the end of the film?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nFrance\n|\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nHebrew\n\n\nRelease Date: 18 February 1999 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Nesyek metseryem\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nGlendale, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$70,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $14,524,321,\n20 December 1998 \n\nGross USA: $101,413,188        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $218,613,188        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n DreamWorks Animation, Dreamworks Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n99 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| SDDS\n| DTS\n| Dolby SR\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.66 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Princess and the Frog finds the lives of arrogant, carefree Prince Naveen and hardworking waitress Tiana crossing paths. Prince Naveen is transformed into a frog by a conniving voodoo magician and Tiana, following suit, upon kissing the amphibian royalty. With the help of a trumpet-playing alligator, a Cajun firefly, and an old blind lady who lives in a boat in a tree, Naveen and Tiana must race to break the spell and fulfill their dreams.\nWritten by\nThe Massie Twins \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n new orleans jazz\n|\n turned into an animal\n|\n fairy tale\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n black protagonist\n|\u00a0See All (128)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The prologue takes place in November of 1912, as indicated by the newspaper with the headline, \"Wilson Elected,\" (referring to President Woodrow Wilson) being read by a streetcar passenger.

This is impossible.\nThere are approximately 29 days between full moons. The date for Easter in Western Christianity is calculated as \"the Sunday following the full Moon which falls on or after the equinox.\" Easter will always be at most 7 days after a full moon. Mardi Gras is 47 days before Easter, and will always occur 11 to 18 days after a full moon.

When Saving Mr. Banks came out a few years back I re-watched the original for first time in years and found a depth I didn't pick up on as a child. So I wasn't really looking forward to a follow up given that the first movie was practically perfect in every way. More to the point who but Andrews could ever do the character justice? Nonetheless, I ventured to see this today because Rob Marshall (he directed the great Chicago) was the director so I had a little bit of hope this would be OK. It is not only OK but it is a wonderful fellow-up to the original film and in some ways closer to the books. My only complaint, and it is exceedingly minor given that it is a family film, is the overall template of Mary Poppins is rather obvious. The new adventure is a bit like the old one and there's a lot of analog scenes between the two films. But given that Mary Poppins returns to help the Banks children again it feels correct that this is the case. The film is surprising in its details, but comforting in its large familiar strokes.I think, and I can't believe this is true, Blunt is the main reason for this. Andrews is the gold standard but Blunt is almost her equal. Her Poppins is funny, stern, warm, knows more than she let's on, has everything in hand and is utterly charming. Blunt is everything you would want from the character and more. I was most surprised by her vocal performance being as good as it is. Jack (Bert's stand in and family relation) is also a great character. Miranda gives an crackerjack performance of charm, wit and wisdom. Best (and weirdest) of all Miranda uses a bad cockney accent all the time (and while singing!) that *somehow* manages to be obviously bad yet believable and adorable. Everyone is so good in this and the thing I thought most likely to sink the picture is the best part.Not to overlook the score because it is so good I just brought it. It is not quite as memorable as the original but it is solidly singable and ear wormy. So while, say, \"Can You Imagine That?\" is not quite as perfect as \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" it is a brilliant song in its own right. The real standout is \"A Cover is not a Book\" as it is clever, funny, and carries a lot of weight in the story. I think I will playing this on a loop for a while.The film is quite technically polished. I would argue that the integration of the live-action and animation is done better here than in the original. The cinematographer, art director, and custom designer did a better job of making the various wolds far more seamless here than in the 1st film. The music hall scene is fun and exciting as well as being a marvel.I thought this film was going to be a disaster. Turns out it is among the best of the year.\n\n\n\n\n                439 of 711 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 1,132 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What happened to George and Winifred banks?

Abandoned by her biological parents as a baby, Annie (Wallis) spends every moment of every day attempting to avoid the wrath of her cruel foster mother Miss Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Thing start to look up for Annie, however, when she has a very public encounter with Will Stacks (Foxx), a local cell-phone mogul with mayoral ambitions. Stacks' campaign isn't going too well until he meets Annie and invites her into his home at the suggestion of his trusted top assistant Grace (Rose Byrne) and his ambitious PR advisor Guy (Bobby Cannavale).

A musical should have great singers; this did not. Foxx, the orphans and Quvenzhane were fine, but they were not great. Consider Dreamgirls, Hairspray, Fiddler on the Roof and Oklahoma. Along with the actors singing in character, there were powerful voices. No one in Annie was a standout musically.Rose Byrne did her job in Damages, but not so much in this movie. The remainder of the cast was competent; they had their occasional moments.This rendition of Annie was okay. But, with a few cast changes and voice lessons, it could have been so much better.\n\n\n\n\n                44 of 88 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 285 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

They project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones that are the core of their being. The Crystal Gems are Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven, a young half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to figure out his powers, he spends his days with his human father Greg, his friend Connie, other people in Beach City, or the other Gems, whether to help them save the world or just to hang out. He explores the abilities passed down to him by his mother, which include fusion (the ability of Gems to merge their identities and bodies to form a new and more powerful personality).\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n cartoon network\n|\n same sex couple\n|\n alien\n|\n 2d animation\n|\n singing\n|\u00a0See All (38)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nBelieve in Steven.        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Action\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Mystery\u00a0|\n Sci-Fi\u00a0|\n Thriller\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Academy Award Winner Billy Bob Thornton and his daughter are fans of the series.

The only difference is the opening titles have different color schemes (sometimes different weather and time of day) for each episode and the end credits always have a night time setting.

It was blatantly offensive, and there was no effort made to have an autistic actor play the role of an autistic character. Because of this, the portrayal of Music is offensive and looks like someone mocking autistic people. There were restraint techniques shown that are dangerous and could kill autistic people, despite this there was no disclaimer like Sia claimed there would be. This is inspiration p*rn by definition, it's a story about autistic people that is made for anyone but us (I have ASD). On top of that, it's badly written. The plot is non-existent, the characters are flat and unrelatable, and the light effects (flashing and bright colors) make is near impossible for lots of autistic and neurodivergent people to watch it. Don't see this movie, it's disgusting and ableist to the core.\n\n\n\n\n                105 of 162 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 321 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Does Sia herself or a friend or family member have autism to warrant it acceptable for her to make a film about it?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            musicthemovie\n    \n|\n\n            Sia's website\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nMandarin\n\n\nRelease Date: 12 February 2021 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Sister\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$16,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $641,783        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Landay Entertainment, Atlantic Films, Crush Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n107 min\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Tess, a retired dancer and owner of the venue, struggles to keep the aging theater alive, facing all kinds of financial and artistic challenges. With the Lounge's troupe members becoming increasingly distracted by personal problems and a threat coming from a wealthy businessman's quest to buy the spot from Tess, the good fortune seems to have abandoned the club altogether. Meanwhile, the life of Ali, a small-town girl from Iowa, is about to change dramatically. Hired by Tess as a waitress at the Lounge, Ali escapes a hollow past and quickly falls in love with the art of burlesque. Backed by newfound friends amongst the theater's crew, she manages to fulfill her dreams of being on stage herself. Things take a dramatic turn though when Ali's big voice makes her become the main attraction of the revue.\nWritten by\nBobby_John \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n burlesque\n|\n homosexual subtext\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n backstage\n|\n rival\n|\u00a0See All (87)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nIn a city of dreams and beyond your imagination, there exists a magical world that comes to life.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for sexual content including several suggestive dance routines, partial nudity, language and some thematic material\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    WILHELM SCREAM: Occurs in the last seconds of the final number, \"Show Me How You Burlesque\".

Natalie was only supposed to be away from the shared apartment short-term, so where are all of her personal belongings? She wouldn't have taken everything she owned for a short trip, and Jack would not have removed every trace of her before Ali moved in. There should be female clothes, shoes, toiletries and other accoutrements around the apartment when Ali arrives, but there are none.

This film has everything, everything but a plot that is. What you should expect from Burlesque is almost two hours of high powered entertainment. Burlesque is just that, entertaining. If you are going to this film to witness a great storyline unfold don't go see this film. However, if you want to be entertained with great vocals from Christina Aguilera and Cher in addition to great acting from Peter Gallagher, Stanley Tucci, Alan Cummings, and again Cher then this film is a must see. I must say prior to the screening that I attended, I was very apprehensive that I was going to see a product that resembled a \"Nine\" / \"Coyote Ugly\" blend of a film, but I was certainly wrong. Burlesque holds itself above the rest of the films in its category. The film obviously cost a lot to produce and I believe that the money was well spent. Cher's performance was excellent. Say what you want about the person, but the actress conveys a confidence level in front of the camera as though she has done this a hundred times. Stanley Tucci is also quite merit worthy in this film. His performance in \"Lovely Bones\" is still haunting and his role as Cher's right-hand gay best friend/costume designer in this film just shows what incredible range this actor has. The costume design, casting, choreography and set design for this film are also worthy of mention. You can count on this film definitely being nominated in the Best Film in Comedy or Musical category for the Golden Globes in December. This film will also do incredibly well at the box office. I would have no problem watching this film again.\n\n\n\n\n                106 of 159 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 268 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How many songs are left out of the soundtrack?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 3 February 2011 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Burlesque\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nLos Angeles, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$55,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $11,947,744,\n28 November 2010 \n\nGross USA: $39,440,655        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $89,520,336        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Screen Gems, De Line Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n119 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nSDDS\n| DTS\n| Dolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39:1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now a teen hero, she starts using her fame to speak out for the causes she believes in, most of all integration. In doing so, she earns the wrath of the show's former star, Amber Von Tussle, as well as Amber's manipulative, pro-segregation parents. The rivalry comes to a head as Amber and Tracy vie for the title of Miss Auto Show 1963.\nWritten by\nJean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n campy\n|\n overweight teenager\n|\n psychotronic film\n|\n nerd\n|\n cult director\n|\u00a0See All (65)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA movie with a beat you can laugh to!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    While Negro Day is a pivotal element of all three versions of \"Hairspray\", it's never seen in this movie or the stage musical.

I wondered what it was about Waters' style as a filmmaker that could provoke such anger? I think it's his affection for '60s movie-clich\u00e9s transposed through nostalgia and Waters' own gross-out sensibilities (and his particular brand of humor, which can be quite wicked). I didn't much care for the film the first time I saw it, but I gave it a second chance and it grew on me. The reckless amateurishness is off-putting at first, but you have to meet \"Hairspray\" halfway. There is much to enjoy here, not the least of which is Divine as Ricki Lake's mom (and also as a bigoted network bigwig); wheeling and dealing after her daughter finds TV fame, Divine becomes a coiffed society queen, twisting away in front of the television and tossing off jaded quips like, \"It's the times...they're a-changin'.\" The performances are all happily hammy, colorful and amusing, and the lightweight story comfortably shoehorns-in relevant political issues to counterbalance the slapstick. Ricki Lake is very appealing in her debut; also hilarious, Pia Zadora as a beatnik and Debbie Harry as the mother of Lake's main rival (\"1-2-cha-cha-CHA, 1-2-cha-cha-CHA!\"). It's not a seamless, polished picture, but it does have heart and charm and this sold me--but on the second time around. *** from ****\n\n\n\n\n                17 of 22 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 66 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Both \"Hairspray\" films are rated PG.

The next week, Troy returns to East High, his high school in New Mexico, to find that Gabriella is a new student there. They quickly become close friends and accidentally audition for the school musical. They both get callbacks, infuriating drama queen Sharpay Evans and her sidekick brother Ryan. Then Chad, Troy's best friend and basketball teammate, and Taylor, Gabriella's new friend on the decathlon team, must make Gabriella hate Troy.\nWritten by\nShannonO'Reilly \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n basketball movie\n|\n disney channel original movie\n|\n high school\n|\n singing\n|\n 2000s\n|\u00a0See All (42)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThis School Rocks Like No Other!        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    \"High School Musical\" was the working title for the film while producers brainstormed a better name.

It starts off when Troy Bolton (a basketball superstar) meets Gabriella (a pretty genius) at a new years eve party on vacation when they are chosen to sing together for a karaoke contest. when Troy goes back to school to find that she is the new girl , they must both make hard decisions- should they do what they're heads are telling them to do ( which is to stick with basketball and smarts to do what they're friends want) or go with they're hearts and sing together.\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 11 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 768 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is this film based on a novel?\n\n\nQ:\n Is Ryan gay?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            DisneyNOW\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nSpanish\n\n\nRelease Date: 31 August 2007 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: High School Musical: Premiers pas sur sc\u00e8ne\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nEast High School - 840 S 1300 E, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$4,200,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Salty Pictures, First Street Films \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n98 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 HD\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Admittedly, I was already a huge fan of the D's work - I loved the HBO series and listen to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing along to), but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight's screening (for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen). With Tenacious D's \"The Pick of Destiny,\" this is not the case.Simply put, this film rocks harder than anything I've seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell together could produce. It tells the story of the D before we came to know them, setting up intriguing histories of Kage and Jables' upbringings, their comings together, and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as Lee, Sasquatch, and Dio. Most importantly, they reveal the true inspiration to the Greatest Song In The World, \"Tribute,\" and how it came to be (which is different than the HBO Series' version). After you've witnessed it you probably won't be able to remember it (hence the Tribute), but your mind forever be changes by its genius.I don't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking, paying outrageous concession prices, etc., but I usually make exceptions when it's starring someone I really love or concerning something of the the same variety. \"The Pick of Destiny\" was so good that I have no qualms going back to see it again when it releases nationwide, and I plan on convincing all of my friends to go, too. Last week we saw \"Borat\" and loved it, but this is honest to goodness TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance, see this film. These guys' talent is so great you should have no hesitation supporting their cause. You will not be disappointed, and the Rock Lords will smile upon you favorably.\n\n\n\n\n                166 of 239 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 219 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Who played Sasquatch?\n\n\nQ:\n What other works have Tenacious D appeared in?\n\n\nQ:\n Who are Tenacious D?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nGermany\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 22 November 2006 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nHalfway House Cafe - 15564 Sierra Highway, Santa Clarita, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$20,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $3,110,000,\n26 November 2006 \n\nGross USA: $8,334,575        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $13,939,963        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Red Hour Films, MACRON Filmproduktion \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n93 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| SDDS\n| Dolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Monumental Pictures' biggest stars, glamorous on-screen couple Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood, are also an off-screen couple if the trade papers and gossip columns are to be believed. Both perpetuate the public perception if only to please their adoring fans and bring people into the movie theaters. In reality, Don barely tolerates her, while Lina, despite thinking Don beneath her, simplemindedly believes what she sees on screen in order to bolster her own stardom and sense of self-importance. R.F. Simpson, Monumental's head, dismisses what he thinks is a flash in the pan: talking pictures. It isn't until The Jazz Singer (1927) becomes a bona fide hit which results in all the movie theaters installing sound equipment that R.F. knows Monumental, most specifically in the form of Don and Lina, have to jump on the talking picture bandwagon, despite no one at the studio knowing anything about the technology. Musician Cosmo Brown, Don's best friend, gets hired as Monumental's ...\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n movie studio\n|\n 1920s\n|\n film within a film\n|\n femme fatale\n|\n hollywood california\n|\u00a0See All (225)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nSingin' Swingin' Glorious Feelin' Technicolor Musical                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRe-Issue from 1952\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Only two songs were written especially for the film: \"Moses Supposes\" was written by Roger Edens, Betty Comden and Adolph Green; \"Make 'em Laugh\" was written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown especially for Donald O'Connor. It's generally agreed that Freed and Brown lifted a great deal of the song's melody from Cole Porter's \"Be a Clown.\" Irving Berlin was visiting the set one day when he heard a playback of \"Make 'em Laugh.\" When Berlin commented on its uncanny similarity to \"Be a Clown,\" Freed quickly changed the subject.

The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song & dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in \"The Nanny\" (1993).Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.But the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and d\u00e9nouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor's careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.But Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they're showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.Donen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the \"Make 'Em Laugh\" sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended \"Broadway Rhythm Ballet\" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the \"Singing in the Rain\" sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it's just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the \"Singing in the Rain\" sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly's umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, \"rain\" is pouring down on him.While there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD. If you're relatively unfamiliar with classic Hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start.\n\n\n\n\n                118 of 143 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 737 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What was the real first full-length 'talkie'?\n\n\nQ:\n Why was shooting the title song challenging for the filmmakers?\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 11 April 1952 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Cantando bajo la lluvia\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios - 10202 W.

Considering his earlier 90's movies which were terrible. This was the only one to make any money, and that is mainly because, let's face it, he surrendered to the hegemony of the Disney-formula with princesses and romance and musical song-and-dance numbers. It's by no means the worst thing he could do, because the final product turned out pretty damn well. As long as you do not mind the history aspect of the story. It is fiction with characters named after historical personalities, nothing more. Just like Disney's \"Pocahontas\", but done a million times better. The characters are well made and play off each other very well, indeed. The villain we get is well balanced between being silly and intimidating. And he, in my opinion, has the greatest song in the movie! Damn, \"In the Dark of the Night\" is awesome with great animated movement, a prominent choir which adds to the grandeur of it and a great build-up from start to finish. The other songs are good, too. \"Once Upon a December\" is melodic and catchy\nwith a beautifully animated scene when it is being played for the first time in the movie. I sometimes wonder why that one wasn't nominated for the Acedemy Award for best original song, but settled for a Golden Globe nomination. Personally, I don't find \"Journey to the Past\" that spectacular. I like Anastasia, but i'm still kind of torn on it, because it still buys so much into the Disney-formula that many casual movie-goers still refer to it as \"that Disney movie\". I like it, but I prefer Bluth's movies from the 80's.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 9 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 228 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Did Alexandra allow the girls to smoke?\n\n\nQ:\n Did Anastasia really survive?\n\n\nQ:\n Is this a Disney movie?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nRussian\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 3 April 1998 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Anastasia\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nChicago Illinois, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$50,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $120,541,\n16 November 1997 \n\nGross USA: $58,406,347        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $139,804,348        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Twentieth Century Fox, Fox Animation Studios, Fox Family Films \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n94 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n(as dts)\u00a0(DTS HD Master Audio 5.1)\u00a0(5.1 Surround Sound)\u00a0(5.1)| Dolby Digital\n(as Dolby Digital)\u00a0(Dolby Digital 5.1)\u00a0(5.1 Surround Sound)\u00a0(5.1)| SDDS\n(as Sony Dynamic Digital Sound)\u00a0(8 channels)\u00a0(5.1 Surround Sound)\u00a0(5.1)| D-Cinema 48kHz 5.1\n(D-Cinema prints)\u00a0(5.1 Surround Sound)\u00a0(5.1)| Dolby Atmos\n(Dolby Atmos)\u00a0(5.1 Surround Sound)\u00a0(5.1)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Robin finds that much of what he knew of England has gone to ruin, including his longtime family home having been taken away, all at the hands of the evil Prince John, Richard's brother who has assumed the throne in Richard's absence. Neurotic John is basically being controlled by the equally evil Sheriff of Rottingham, everything they do to fatten their own coffers at the expense of the commoners and peasants. As such, Robin recruits a band of merry men to help him battle Prince John and the Sheriff, they, who include: Blinkin, his blind longtime servant; Ahchoo, the misguided son of Asneeze, the man who helped him escape from prison while fighting in the Crusades; Little John, who seems to think that being called Little is only coincidental to the fact of he being a hulking man; and Little John's friend,...\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n spoof\n|\n rabbi\n|\n castle\n|\n king\n|\n sheriff\n|\u00a0See All (265)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Legend Had It Coming...        \n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for off-color humor\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    When Achoo dons the glasses to speak to the villagers, he says 'We didn't land on Sherwood Forest; Sherwood Forest landed on us!\" This is a rendition of a speech given by black rights activist Malcolm X on 29 March 1964.

I do, and the series reran in my mind many times while watching Mel's big-screen take.I guess he had to do this to take a few shots at Kevin Costner's \"Prince of Thieves\", but this one also takes aim at and makes points of reference to \"White Men Can't Jump\", Bruce Lee films, Larry King, seders and even brings out the reserves from Mel's projects of yore (McCann, Van Patten, De Luca, De Luise).Some gags work, some don't but as always, Mel tries.  Too bad he's working under the restrictions of that darned PG rating.  What Mel could have done in his heyday with an R rated \"Robin Hood\"!  Though admittedly, the finale of Robin's (Elwes') serenade to Maid Marian (Yasbeck) earns big laughs. Loved finding out the first name of the Sheriff of Rottingham (Rees), as well.  You will, too.As I've said before, any Mel is good Mel.  If you've seen any Robin Hood movie, good.  You'll get a lot of the references here.  Even with the Mafia connections, hot tubs, and the new Club for horses.Five stars.

Except for the comedy, both seem very similar in looks, voices and mannerisms. It would surprise me if Mel Brooks used it as inspiration for his character as he does with many of his movies. I can't seem to find anything, so it may just be coincidence.\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nFrance\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 28 July 1993 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Las locas aventuras de Robin Hood\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nSanta Clarita, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$20,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $6,841,830,\n1 August 1993 \n\nGross USA: $35,739,755        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $35,739,755        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Brooksfilms, Gaumont \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n104 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby SR\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The beauty of Lucy attracts the attention of the corrupt Judge Turpin, who falsely accuses the barber of a crime that he did not commit and abuses Lucy later after gaining custody of her. After fifteen years in exile, Benjamin returns to London under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, seeking revenge against Turpin. He meets the widow Mrs. Lovett who is the owner of a meat pie shop who tells him that Lucy swallowed arsenic many years ago, and Turpin assigned himself tutor of Johanna. He opens a barber shop above her store, initiating a crime rampage against those who made him suffer and lose his beloved family.\nWritten by\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n razor\n|\n based on stage musical\n|\n serial killer\n|\n barbershop\n|\n throat slitting\n|\u00a0See All (138)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nJohnny Depp is THE BARBER.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Horror\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Thriller\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n18\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nStephen Sondheim has credited the score of Hangover Square (1945) by Bernard Herrmann as an influence on his own.

The different angles focus more Sweeney instead of the immense amounts of blood that can be seen more vividly in the International cut. All in all it only amounts to around 3-5 seconds that are actually different and were needed in order to get the R-Rated in the US.

I am also sure that no one in film is better able to play the titular butcher than the shape-shifting, ever-naughty Johnny Depp.The opening song \"No Place Like London\" hints to Anglophiles like me that it won't be my usual tour of West End theaters, rather a seedy, dangerous place where Mac the Knife would be more at home. Throughout the musical, Steven Sondheim's lyrics expressively revel in the amoral, throat-slicing world that Sweeney and his adoring meatpie lady, Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham-Carter), wallow in as he prepares to take revenge on the equally amoral Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who dispatched Todd to prison early on to get his beautiful young wife. Hence Sweeney's revenge inclination.Sweeney's lyric best expresses the wildly murderous world, hardly the usual province of musicals: \"Alright! You, Sir?/No one's in the chair come on, come on/Sweeney's waiting/I want you bleeders./You sir! Too sir?/Welcome to the grave./I will have vengeance./I will have salvation . . . .\" Yes, it's Sleepy-Hollow, Corpse-Bride Tim Burton's movie with blood spouting like red paint from a pressure gun contrasting the somber, almost black and white underside of London. When one of the children bites into a pie with a finger in it (shades of our contemporary law suits!), the audience doesn't even gasp, given the omnipresence of bloody bodies.There is no more interesting musical this year, even considering the enchanting Once. In the end, it is unsettling, unsavory, and unusual. Burton does better than anyone else in juxtaposing horror with innocence.\n\n\n\n\n                152 of 242 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 879 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why is \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" only in the film as an instrumental?\n\n\nQ:\n What is a beadle?\n\n\nQ:\n Who Is Mrs. Mooney?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site [UK]\n    \n|\n\n            Warner Bros.

Spoofing Elvis movies and Juvenile Delinquency scare films of the '50s, this movie follows the adventures of Cry-Baby who, though he is sent to juvie, is determined to cross class (and taste) boundaries to get Allison back.\nWritten by\nLinda (& Moo) \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n 1950s\n|\n forbidden love\n|\n dysfunctional family\n|\n greaser\n|\n teen movie\n|\u00a0See All (89)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nGood girls want him bad.

The cinema release was rated 12, but the video release was still rated 15 (because the 12 certificate wasn't used for video recordings until 1994). The current UK DVD release has all uses of 'fuck' unbleeped, and is rated 15.

But, I figured, hey, it's JD, why not? And, I now must say, that is goes down as one of my favorite movies. Why? because it's an amazing spoof my John Waters. As a lover of old musicals from the 50s and 60s, it's just amusing to watch a spoof of them, especially one done so well as this. My fav scene (don't worry..no spoilers..) is one where Crybaby (JD) performs a song in a comedic Elvis Presley fashion, which shows how dynamic JD is as an actor. what else makes this movie great? The music. There's not one boring song where you feel like it'll never end, because you don't want it to end. (yes, i own the soundtrack..i'm pathetic, i know). It's just a great movie..well, if you like a musical that spoofs other musicals.\n\n\n\n\n                66 of 80 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 177 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 13 July 1990 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Llora nena\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nUSA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$11,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $3,004,905,\n8 April 1990 \n\nGross USA: $8,266,343        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $8,266,343        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Universal Pictures, Imagine Entertainment \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n85 min\n|\n91 min\n            (director's cut)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Some film historians cite this failure as prime evidence that the original Hollywood musical had begun to lose its box-office clout around 1955. \"It's Always Fair Weather\" grossed $1,380,000 in the US and Canada and $994,000 overseas resulting in a net loss of $1,675,000 for MGM.

The visual quality after almost 50 years is still pretty good, but the soundtrack was \"wobbly.\"  The film needs some restoration.As others have said, the highlights of this film are the clever dance numbers, specifically:the garbage can lid dance by the 3 soldiers (they also hop, crawl and dance around a stopped taxi, but nobody has mentioned that one),\nthe wonderful roller skating sequence by Kelly (since I'm tired to death of seeing the \"Singing in the Rain\" puddle dance, this is a refreshing change and an excellent sample of his skills!)  He even parodies his \"Rain\" dance when he hops off & on the curb with his skates (folks, those are metal-wheeled skates - nowhere as smooth & speedy as the polyurethane ones of today)  Somebody mentioned that the skating set features a big piece of the \"Rain\" set, but I don't agree - we're talking films set 30 years apart & I didn't see any similarities in the \"Fair Weather\" setDolores Gray's bizarre number \"Thanks but no Thanks\" where she rewards the tuxedoed men bearing jewels and affection (who literally vault, flip and tumble around her) with bullets, dynamite and finally a huge trap door where they all slide awayand Cyd Charisse's gym number \"Baby You Knock Me Out\"(these last 2 numbers were featured on \"That's Entertainment III\")It's interesting to see Michael Kidd, mostly known for his wonderful film choreography, dance onscreen.  Wish there was more of it. And Dan Dailey I hardly know, except for the film \"There's No Business Like Show Business.\"  He's the only actor of the 3 to let himself \"age\" in the ensuing 10 years, and it works.  He does a very good job in the acting department too.You can see why the film is not a lasting classic in league with \"On the Town\" and \"Singing in the Rain\" - it contains elements of bitterness & disillusionment between the 3 guys.  They seem to get along best when they're either drunk or fighting bad guys. And the film - this is a sign of the times - glamorizes smoking (including by Dan Dailey's character, who says he won't drink or eat heavily b/c of his health, yet he \"lights up\" often), fixed boxing matches, gambling and drunken sprees.Still, it makes an excellent \"sequel\" of sorts for \"On the Town\" and they should be paired together on TV or at film fests.Also, Previn's tunes are not really memorable - they're OK.The film also pokes fun at early TV - Delores Gray's show is a mix btw a variety show & something like \"Queen for a Day\" or \"This is Your Life.\" Sponsors (in this case, laundry detergent)were a huge deal back then. Oddly, she's not paired with one of the guys as a romantic interest.  Her diva act gets a bit tiresome however.Cyd only gets 1 dance number, and there's no dance between her & Gene.  Wish there were.  They sparked a HUGE amount of chemistry in their dance number in \"Rain.\"Look out for familiar actors in small supporting roles, like Madge Blake (she was a radio gossip at the movie premiere in \"Singin in the Rain\" but most of you would know her as dotty Aunt Harriett in the Batman TV series), and the actor who plays the sports columnist at the gym is a character actor who has appeared in dozens of TV shows from the 1950s & 60s, besides movie appearances.  And that's June Foray's uncredited voice in the animated Kleenzrite commercial - she did the voice of Rocky Squirrel, among many other voiceovers.Still, I do recommend it, considering it is not shown very much, let alone in the letterbox format which is necessary for the integrity of the movie. Darn that pesky pan & scan! The ahead-of-its-time plot & the clever dance numbers make this film worth your while.\n\n\n\n\n                37 of 46 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 75 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The Broadway incarnation contains the tradition with references to a slew of other musicals, including Wicked, Chicago, The Lion King, Gypsy, Les Miserables, Once Upon a Mattress, RENT, A Chorus Line, Evita, and Dreamgirls.

After watching \"Phantom\" at the Royal Albert Hall and then this one as a presentation on Netflix, I'm hoping that more will be saved for always. This is not the world's greatest musical, but it is full of life, wonderful characters, and a nice edge to it. It has two or three very good songs and lots of topical material. The two leads in particular capture the Disney original and are able to poke fun at themselves. If there is a downside, it does go on a bit long and the fairy tale characters aren't used quite as much as they could be. I remember seeing Prince Farquhar on the Tony Awards and was amazed at his dexterity, playing the entire part on his knees. I would imagine that most of the theater goers already know the plot but the magic still gets us from the get go.\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 15 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 26 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The third and final film was bittersweet as it was well written and acted yet sad with Cameron Boyce's death a few weeks before the premiere. As a parent, I found it great with fun songs, good and evil uniting to be good and the Disney characters in it portrayed to perfection! Well done!!\n\n\n\n\n                18 of 22 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 90 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

As a result, to help Emma, a bright-eyed high-school student who has recently come out of the closet, make her dream come true, the flamboyant celebrity activists and their fellow struggling actors, Angie Dickinson and Trent Oliver, head to the small town of Edgewater, Indiana, to right a wrong. But, Emma only wants to take her girlfriend to the prom, and intolerance stands in the way of acceptance and happiness. Can the bold quartet give Emma the prom she deserves?\nWritten by\nNick Riganas \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n reference to beauty and the beast the broadway musical\n|\n high school\n|\n prom\n|\n lgbt\n|\n indiana\n|\u00a0See All (225)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nIt's time to celebrate change.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for thematic elements, some suggestive/sexual references and language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    There's a scene in which Barry mentions Dee Dee's angry lashing out at the Longacre Theatre. The original Broadway production of The Prom opened at the Longacre Theater in 2018.

There is no way a high school in Indiana would have an open air cafeteria like this, it is clear it was filmed at a high school in a warmer climate.

The subject matter is definitely worthy of attention, but this movie will probably not stay in your mind for long. An easy movie to watch that is close to deserving a failing grade.\n\n\n\n\n                32 of 63 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 459 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Fanny Brice knows that she is a talented comedienne and singer. She also knows that she is not the beauty typical of the stage performers of the day, she with skinny legs and a crooked nose among other physical issues. So she knows she has to use whatever other means to get her break in show business, that break so that she can at least display her talents. With the help of Eddie Ryan who would become her friend, Fanny is able to get a part in a novelty act in a vaudeville show, the renown from which eventually comes to the attention of famed impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.. Fanny does become one of the Ziegfeld Follies most popular acts, despite she almost getting fired after her first performance by defying Flo's artistic vision for her closing number. Beyond stage success, Fanny also wants a happy personal life, most specifically with the suave Nicky Arnstein, a gambler in every respect of the word. Fanny loves him and loves that he loves her ...\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n singer\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n husband wife relationship\n|\n actress\n|\n national film registry\n|\u00a0See All (209)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nHello, gorgeous!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Biography\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nMike Nichols, George Roy Hill, and Gene Kelly were considered to direct the film before Sidney Lumet was signed.

Better than that...I'd venture to say that alongside Vivien Leigh's masterful performance in \"Gone With The Wind,\" Barbra's portrayal of vaudeville icon Fanny Brice may be one of the most ambitious, captivating turns by a lead actress ever captured on film. Even Barbra-phobes would have to concede that the woman completely knocked herself out with \"Funny Girl\" and her renditions of \"I'm The Greatest Star,\" \"My Man,\" \"People\" and especially the pulse-jolting \"Don't Rain On My Parade\" rank right up there with the best of Judy Garland (\"Over The Rainbow,\" \"The Trolley Song\" and \"The Man That Got Away.\"). Because Streisand has been an exalted Hollywood legend for many decades, people tend to almost take her remarkable talents - both as an actress and as a singer - for granted now but this opulent musical, sparkling score and her thrilling, take-no-prisoners performance will endure as a testament to what pure show business, high octane theatricality and legitimate talent are all about. Sing Proud, Barbra!\n\n\n\n\n                31 of 37 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 105 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Dexter-Haven, a successful popular jazz musician, lives in a mansion near his ex-wife's Tracy Lord's family estate. She is on the verge of marrying a man blander and safer than Dex, who tries to win Tracy's heart again. Mike Connor, an undercover tabloid reporter, also falls for Tracy while covering the nuptials for Spy magazine. Tracy must choose between the three men as she discovers that \"safe\" can mean \"deadly dull\" when it comes to husbands and life.\nWritten by\nJames Meek <james@oz.net> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n reporter\n|\n wedding\n|\n jazz\n|\n newport rhode island\n|\n socialite\n|\u00a0See All (29)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA New High In The Movie Sky.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nGrace Kelly, recently engaged to Prince Rainier of Monaco, wore her actual engagement ring for her character's engagement ring.

Some of the blame should go to the uninspired direction of Walter Charles, who can't overcome what the great George Cukor achieved in the original movie version. Part of the blame is shared with John Patrick's screen play that might have been based on the Philip Barry play, but what one sees on the screen is a dull attempt of movie making. Donald Ogden Stewart, who adapted the original play gave that film a light and fun touch, which in Mr. Cukor's hands and brilliant direction came alive throughout the picture.It's not fair to make comparisons, but unfortunately, the creators of \"High Society\" leave themselves wide open for it. Right off the start, these stars can't compare with the magnificent performances by Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Ruth Hussey and the irresistible Virginia Weidler.Grace Kelly was an elegant actress who as Tracy Lord gives the role another interpretation but doesn't capture the spirit of the no-nonsense socialite she is supposed to be. Bing Crosby, as Dexter, has some good moments, especially in the \"True Love\" segment in the yacht with Tracy. Frank Sinatra's Mike Connors is all right, although we can't just imagine how he can be in love with Liz Imbrie. Celeste Holm who appears as Liz gave a tamed reading of her character.The best thing in the film is the prologue and the finale with the incomparable Louis Armstrong, whose presence would have been used to put some sparkle in this subdued version of Philip Barry's wonderful play.\n\n\n\n\n                30 of 46 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 168 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Premiere of \"High Society\"---Who Attended?\n\n\nQ:\n \"Philadelphia Story\"---How Did It Get Re-made as \"High Society\"?\n\n\nQ:\n Chapter Headings, an unofficial version:\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            HBOMAX [United States]\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 17 July 1956 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Alta sociedad\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios - 10202 W.

However, MGM was unable to unearth Dailey's unique talents, and it would not be until after WWII that the triple threat performer would find his footing as a valued and match utilized contract player at 20th Century-Fox.

The songs and dances are great, too, with two of the high points being beautiful Ann Sothern's \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\" and Eleanor Powell's dancing finale. But most amazing of all is Powell's duet with her dog. This number should be rated along with Fred Astaire's dance on the ceiling in \"Royal Wedding\" and Donald O'Connor's \"Make 'Em Laugh\" as one of the best of all time. If you're looking for social commentary, turn on NPR. If you want something deep, find a stable and pick up a shovel. This movie was meant to be fun and entertaining, and it succeeds perfectly on both counts.\n\n\n\n\n                28 of 38 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 36 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Because, whilst the first Lego Movie could work with the fact that the audience wasn't aware of the origins of the movie's story (this origin being a child's imagination), this movie had to work with an audience aware of this origin. The movie accepts this and integrates scene's with real actors in the movie. This, luckily, isn't done to an extend where it would be annoying and distracting from the story being portrayed with Lego bricks. It does, however, try to replace the reveal of the first movie, with another reveal. Sadly, this reveal isn't even close to being on the same level as the reveal of the first movie. It turns out to be a bit clich\u00e9, which I felt a bit disappointed about.\nOnce again, the filmmakers have some great references to other franchises. These references make for some great laughs. The jokes in this movie are simple and not too hard to understand, but aren't childish. This makes the movie a fun ride for child, teenager and adult.\nAs a standalone movie, I feel it lacks world- and character-building. The movie throws characters at you, without (re-)explaining their origins to you. I feel like you are expected to have seen the first movie, because of this.\nThis movie overall does a really good job for people looking for a fun ride. It is far from a bad movie, but there were some possibility's for it to be a better one.\n\n\n\n\n                49 of 72 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 416 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

This holiday season, enter a colorful, wondrous world populated by hilariously unforgettable characters and discover the story of the overly optimistic Trolls, with a constant song on their lips, and the comically pessimistic Bergens, who are only happy when they have trolls in their stomach. Featuring original music from Justin Timberlake, and soon-to-be classic mash-ups of songs from other popular artists, the film stars the voice talents of Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Russell Brand, James Corden, Kunal Nayyar, Ron Funches, Icona Pop, Gwen Stefani, and many more. DreamWorks' TROLLS is a fresh, broad comedy filled with music, heart and hair-raising adventures. In November of 2016, nothing can prepare you for our new Troll world.\nWritten by\n20th Century Fox \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n glitter\n|\n depression\n|\n troll doll\n|\n 3d animation\n|\n female protagonist\n|\u00a0See All (48)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nSing.

And my 2.5 year old loved it! As far as he is concerned, it currently has infinite replay value. He really seems to like movies that have a great sound track...which this one does. The songs are enjoyable covers of easily recognizable pop songs from several decades, with some modified lyrics. The point is, if a film entertains your kid many times over, then the writers did something right. The plot was simple and was about what I expected. If you really hated this movie, stop being such a Bergen and lighten up!\n\n\n\n\n                59 of 66 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 215 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

As the boy grows older, the wise panther Bagheera realizes he must be returned to his own kind in the nearby man-village. Baloo the bear, however, thinks differently, taking the young Mowgli under his wing and teaching him that living in the jungle is the best life there is. Bagheera realizes that Mowgli is in danger, particularly from Shere Khan the tiger who hates all people. When Baloo finally comes around, Mowgli runs off into the jungle where he survives a second encounter with Kaa the snake and finally, with Shere Khan. It's the sight of a pretty girl, however, that draws Mowgli to the nearby man-village and stay there.\nWritten by\ngarykmcd \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n jungle\n|\n bear\n|\n wild child\n|\n india\n|\n musical number\n|\u00a0See All (146)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nMeet KIPLING'S famous characters...the V.I.P.s of the Jungle!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nSebastian Cabot, Clint Howard, Bruce Reitherman and Sterling Holloway the voices of Bagheera, the little elephant, Mowgli and Kaa previously worked on Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966) as the voices of the Narrator, Christopher Robin, Roo and Winnie the Pooh, respectively, which was released a year before this film came out.

It's based on the \"Mowgli\" stories by Rudyard Kipling (who also wrote the famous Just So Stories). Like in most Disney films, Mowgli is an orphan. Bagheera the panther find him and he is raised by a family of wolves. That is until Shere Khan the tiger comes back to the jungle...One thing I love about The Jungle Book is the villains. In most Disney movies you have one villain, sometimes with stupid and funny sidekicks who get bossed around all the time. But The Jungle Book offers three villains all who want Mowgli all for themselves. There is King Louie the king of the monkeys. He kidnaps Mowgli but doesn't really want to harm him, which perhaps makes him the least cruelest of the three. All he wants is to be like man as he puts it in the wonderful song that will want to make you get up and dance: \"I Wanna Be Like You\". More specifically he wants to know the secret on how to make fire. Then there's Shere Khan, the tiger who comes back to the jungle and is the reason that Bagheera and the wolves (and eventually Baloo) want to take him back to the \"man village\". Shere Khan is very swift and cruel but also very calm about his cruelty and not the least bit temperamental. However his characteristics do change at his last screen appearance, and frankly I'd be freaking out to if I had a burning branch stuck to my tail (heck I'd freak out if I just had a tail). Shere Khan hates mankind and of course Mowgli is man. Last but definitely not least (my favorite of the three)- Kaa, the snake, and a very big one I might add. See- King Louie wants to be like Mowgli, Shere Khan wants to kill Mowgli and Kaa wants to... eat Mowgli. He has a very big mouth which would enable him to eat Mowgli but it does him bad too- he talks to much and then never gets the chance to eat Mowgli. Other than these three memorable villains there's Mowgli himself, the man-cub (who by the way was voiced by Bruce Reitherman, son of the director of this film- and many other Disney greats: Wolfgang Reitherman). There's the elephants, the vultures (who are actually nice and quite humorous too), Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther. Songs include King Louie's (who was voiced by Louie Parma) \"I Wanna Be Like You\". Kaa's \"Trust in Me\" (which no one should... trust in Kaa that is). And of course Baloo's \"The Bare Necessities\".As for the racist overtone- that's one of the silliest things I've heard. The Jungle Book can be enjoyed by anyone of any age (...and any race).\n\n\n\n\n                55 of 87 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 176 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why is the movie entitled 'The Jungle Book' when there are no references to the original book in the movie?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 18 October 1967 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Sefer Ha-Jungle\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

They are fascinated by these shapely creatures and discover that the broadcast came from Southern California on Earth. Meanwhile, Valley girl Valerie Gail feels her cold fianc\u00e9 Dr. Ted Gallagher is slipping away and decides to seduce him. Instead, she catches him cheating on her with a nurse, throws him out, smashes his things and refuses to see him again. The aliens' spaceship crash lands in Valerie's swimming pool - putting a decided damper on her future wedding plans in Las Vegas. She brings them into her home; and the aliens prove to be quick learners and absorb American popular culture and language through television.\nWritten by\nMark Harding <mah@imdb.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n suntan pantyhose\n|\n alien contact\n|\n spacecraft\n|\n bare chested male\n|\n reference to tina turner\n|\u00a0See All (63)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nEight out of ten aliens agree...Earth Girls Are Easy                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\u00a0|\n Sci-Fi\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In Valerie Gail's dream sequence during her first night with Mac, Lectroids from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1984) (one of Jeff Goldblum's previous films) can be briefly seen.

Valerie (Geena Davis) is an every-woman in southern California whose life is turned upside down when three aliens, Mac (Jeff Goldblum), Wiploc (Jim Carrey) and Zeebo (Damon Wayans), land in her swimming pool. She quickly gets them made up to look human, but they continue acting like non-humans. She has to explain sex to Mac, while Wiploc and Zeebo are still wacky.In a way, the whole movie is an excuse to be silly. But believe you me, they come up with some really funny stuff (Jim Carrey does a great James Dean impression). You'll wish that some aliens could land in your swimming pool, or wherever near your house.\n\n\n\n\n                27 of 31 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 96 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

But Frollo was forced by the Archdeacon of Notre Dame to raise Quasimodo as his own. Now a young man, Quasimodo is hidden from the world by Frollo in the belltower of the cathedral. But during the Festival of Fools, Quasimodo, cheered on by his gargoyle friends Victor, Hugo, and Laverne, decides to take part in the festivities, where he meets the lovely gypsy girl Esmeralda and the handsome soldier Phoebus. The three of them find themselves ranged against Frollo's cruelty and his attempts to destroy the home of the gypsies, the Court of Miracles. And Quasimodo must desperately defend both Esmeralda and the very cathedral of Notre Dame.\nWritten by\nKathy Li \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n based on novel\n|\n bound and gagged\n|\n disney acid sequence\n|\n star died before release\n|\n baby boy\n|\u00a0See All (134)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nJoin the Party, June 21st        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Two of the gargoyles are named Victor and Hugo after Victor Hugo, the author of the novel \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\" The third, Laverne, is named after Laverne Andrews, one of The Andrews Sisters.

Now, Victor Hugo's original vision is put with color from disney, and it is still dramatic and sad, but it amazingly works into the Dinsey family fold, even if it is erotic, killing and weird. Great fun in voices from Thomas Hulce, Demi Moore, kevin Kline, Tonyt Jay and Jason Alexander as a gargoyle.  One of the better animated films to come around in the 90's.

This incident sends Evan on a journey of self-discovery and gives him the chance to finally be accepted by his peers and live the life he never dreamed he could have.\nWritten by\nMax Hechtman \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n based on broadway musical\n|\n autism\n|\n social anxiety disorder\n|\n suicide\n|\n youth suicide\n|\u00a0See All (28)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The stage musical has its origins in an incident that took place during Benj Pasek's high school years at Friends' Central School.

Her powerful father, Chief Powhatan (Russell Means), disapproves of their relationship and wants her to marry a native warrior. Meanwhile, Smith's fellow Englishmen hope to rob the Native Americans of their gold. Can Pocahontas' love for Smith save the day?\nWritten by\nJwelch5742 \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n native american protagonist\n|\n unsubtitled foreign language\n|\n disobedience\n|\n historically inaccurate\n|\n noble savage\n|\u00a0See All (147)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nTwo different worlds.

As congratulations, the animators painted a picture of Pocahontas surrounded by sunflowers. Sunflowers are Irene's favorite flower.

Pocahontas is the daughter of a chief who wishes to find her path in life. She feels it her duty to keep peace between her own people and the intruding British who are hoping to find gold as did the early Spanish explorers. She finds herself falling in love with one of these new visitors and uses this relationship in attempting to prevent a potential war. But can she stop the greedy settlers from their determination to find Gold, and can she convince her Father that they should try to live in peace with their new neighbors? You may be pleasantly surprised. Between the music and the animation Pocahontas is a classic Disney film that should be included in every video collection. Just don't expect to learn any hidden truths about American history. Take it for what it is.\n\n\n\n\n                18 of 28 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 274 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Was there really a Pocahontas?\n\n\nQ:\n Was there a real Pocahontas?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nAlgonquin\n\n\nRelease Date: 26 June 1995 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0441\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures - 500 S.

When he learns of her wish to see a real tree, Ted seeks out the Once-ler, a ruined old businessman outside of town in a stark wasteland. Upon hearing of how the hermit gave into his greed for profits and devastated the land over the protests of the Lorax, Ted is inspired to undo the disaster. However, the greedy Mayor of Thneed-Ville, Aloysius O'Hare, has made his fortune exploiting the environmental collapse and is determined to stop the boy from undermining his business.\nWritten by\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n corrupt mayor\n|\n crooked mayor\n|\n heroine\n|\n betrayal\n|\n cat\n|\u00a0See All (43)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nMeet the original force of nature.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for brief mild language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    From the creators of \"Despicable Me\".

This is a CHILDREN'S movie! For the love of God! One voter said \"for a children's movie to be successful it needs to cater to both children AND adults?\" No it doesn't you idiot! If that mattered, these cartoons wouldn't make $100 million every time. Another voter said \"if my kid wasn't enjoying it so much, I would have walked out\"! Hilarious! Are you the same guy that would have walked out of Chuck E Cheese if your child wasn't having a great time? Ignorant Clown! And then there are those adults that went to see this without children and complain about the silly music scenes. Get a life! Those scenes weren't created for you. I haven't seen this movie yet...I'm going with my 7 year old in a few minutes. Will I enjoy this movie? Probably Not! As a conservative Republican I will hate it. However, should I not take my son because this cartoon doesn't agree with my philosophies?....UPDATE...I enjoyed it! Thank you to all the nitwits writing misguided bad reviews. I went in with terrible expectations and came out all smiles...but who cares about me. My son loved it and is still wearing my scarf 7 hours later...his new Thneed!\n\n\n\n\n                13 of 28 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 255 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Where did Seuss get the inspiration for The Lorax?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\n            Official site [France]\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nFrance\n|\nJapan\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 29 March 2012 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ha'Lorex\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$70,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $70,217,070,\n4 March 2012 \n\nGross USA: $214,030,500        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $348,840,316        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Universal Pictures, Illumination Entertainment, Dr. Seuss Enterprises \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n86 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| Datasat\n| SDDS\n| Auro 11.1\n| Dolby Surround 7.1\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Just be sure you watch with the right expectations.\n\n                        6 July 2014 | by jcstealth247\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nStory: The story here suffers from too many subplots, and a lack of focus. It also doesn't help that all the subplots here are generic. This would would kill a film......if it was made by someone like Pixar or Studio Ghibli. But since this film's plot isn't the main focus, or why audiences watched the 1st Rio, then the bad story doesn't really hurt this film as much as it could've been. But it's still a bad story nonetheless. 4/10Animation: It's beautiful, gorgeous, colorful, and worth watching on Blu-ray or Blu-ray 3D. 10/10Characters And Comedy: All characters here follow standard archetypes we all know of, but Nigel and Gabi serve as the most original and most entertaining. Comedy is solid with some funny moments in the film. 6/10Sound: Good score and amazing soundtrack. Love the songs here more than Frozen, but none really hit the heights of Hot Wings from the 1st. Although some of the songs do come close. 9/10Acting And Casting: All actors/actresses do a good job voicing their roles, especially with Jesse E. as the voice of Blu. I'm also surprised Bruno Mars didn't suck. 7/10Verdict: Don't watch this film for the story. Watch it like you would a Madagascar film and just sit back, relax, and enjoy an entertaining family film with some beautiful animation, good comedy, and amazing songs.Extra: +1 for being a sequel I enjoyed.Rating: 8/10For a more in-depth review (stupid 1000 word limit), check out my Metacritic review: http://www.metacritic.com/user/DemonicSoul?myscore- filter=Movie\n\n\n\n\n                17 of 22 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 122 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How long is the time gap between the first movie and the second?\n\n\nQ:\n Does this movie take place in Rio de Janeiro?\n\n\nQ:\n Are the chicks different compared to the first film?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official Twitter\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nCanada\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nPortuguese\n\n\nRelease Date: 10 April 2014 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: R\u00edo 2\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$103,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $39,327,869,\n13 April 2014 \n\nGross USA: $131,538,435        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $498,781,117        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Twentieth Century Fox Animation, Blue Sky Studios, FortyFour Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n101 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n| SDDS\n| Datasat\n| Dolby Atmos\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I was a fan once of Disney bringing previous creations to life. They've done it with 101 Dalmatians, Peter Pan, and plenty other films but nowadays it's so much at once and they really want to force these animal adaptions, maleficent was solid, cinderella, Jungle book, Beauty and the beast, Christopher Robin were also all pretty good, they worked very well with jungle book as far as the animal recreations. But ever since 2019 it's been going downhill. Maybe it's because they're really pushing the envelope with these films all at once. Literally a live action Disney film once a year was good enough. But this year we've gotten 4 live action adaptions so Disney can make more money off of stuff they already made. It's absurd, Dumbo was mediocre, Aladdin was ehh, lion king was a huge disappointment and this is even worse. Shame on you disney and I can't believe you people buy this crap. This is garbage period.\n\n\n\n\n                72 of 134 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 330 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Inspired by the strike put on by the trolley workers, Jack \"Cowboy\" Kelly (Christian Bale) organizes a newsboys' strike. With David Jacobs (David Moscow) as the brains of the new union, and Jack as the voice, the weak and oppressed found the strength to band together and challenge the powerful.\nWritten by\nKaitlin Dwyer Rankins \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n orphan\n|\n year 1899\n|\n teenage boy\n|\n paperboy\n|\n based on true story\n|\u00a0See All (60)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nFor years they've delivered the papers.

It takes an orphan, with a stutter, who ain't afraid to use his fists.\" This footage is also present during the song on one of the featurettes, however in the movie, this part is cut, leading straight to the scene where the boys jump over the barrels.During another featurette, one of the cast members mentions that Christian Bale had to learn an extra skill for his part and then there is footage of him with a lasso doing various tricks. This scene appears to be from the \"Santa Fe\" song, although it is not made clear.

One Great Film.\n\n                        3 January 2000 | by JennieB\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\n\"Newsies\" is one of the few Disney films that can be classified as 'great'. What makes it even more amazing is the fact that, although it's a Disney movie and based on actual events, it actually stays very close to what actually happened. (Who would've thought?) The movie has a very good script, great acting, and music that make even the biggest musical-hater tapping his/her feet. Add into this mix show-stopping choreography, humor, and some of the best actors and actresses you can find anywhere, and you will see why this movie has generated more fans than any other movie in history.\n\n\n\n\n                50 of 69 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 305 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

His wish for Pinocchio to be a real boy is unexpectedly granted by a fairy. The fairy assigns Jiminy Cricket to act as Pinocchio's \"conscience\" and keep him out of trouble. Jiminy is not too successful in this endeavor and most of the film is spent with Pinocchio deep in trouble.\nWritten by\nTim Pickett <quetzal@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n italy\n|\n cricket the insect\n|\n puppet\n|\n famous score\n|\n underwater scene\n|\u00a0See All (200)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nWhen you wish upon a star, your dreams come true.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Honest John's \"real\" name is given in promotional materials as J.

(Disney's in-house distribution arm). The 1993 VHS release and 1999 DVD features the Buena Vista logo. However, the overseas DVD release in 2003, the Platinum Edition DVD and Blu-ray releases in 2009 and the Walt Disney Signature Collection DVD and Blu-ray releases in 2017 restored the original RKO logo. But both versions include reissue credits, as reference to Technicolor should have read \"in Technicolor\" but not just \"Technicolor\".

Pinocchio is based on the Italian story about the puppet who became a real boy. Pinocchio is one of Disney`s finest and it beats all the new ultracommercial cartoons, which the company produces nowadays. The story is good, the characters are very likable and warmhearted, and the music is sheer perfection.  These old Disney classics are cartoons that are suitable for the WHOLE family, not just the small kids. Watch it, and prepare to be stunned! 9/10\n\n\n\n\n                33 of 37 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 212 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What happened to all the villains at the end?\n\n\nQ:\n Why was the coachmen turning young boys into donkeys?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 23 February 1940 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Pinocho\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

The combination of a superb cast, wonderful music and breathtaking choreography mean that the film loses nothing in its translation from the stage.  To this day it remains one of the stand-out musical adaptions in a dwindling field.Although the conservative Dickens fanatics may thumb their noses at various liberties taken on the original plot of \"Oliver Twist\", they should observe that \"Oliver!\" has recreated most of the spirit intended by Dickens.  While primarily a musical comedy, \"Oliver!\" certainly has a dark undercurrent, thanks to the skillful direction of Carol Reed and the sinister acting of Oliver Reed (playing Bill Sikes).  Dickens was essentially a talented satirist, who constructed his characters to convey a moralistic view on Victorian society.  \"Oliver!\" conveys much of the sadness and desperation of the original novel.For anyone not acquainted with the famous storyline, the film treats of a young orphan, Oliver Twist, and follows his journey from a paupers' workhouse to the rough-and-tumble city life of London.  He is spotted and introduced into a gang of thieves, led by the crafty and cunning Fagin. What follows for Oliver is an introduction to the art of picking pockets; the methods of justice dispened by Mr Fang the magistrate; the cruelty of Bill Sikes the notorious thief, and the compassion of Nancy, Bill's mate; the kindness of Mr and Mrs Brownlow.  Such an adventure for such a small boy!It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason why this Oscar-winning film is such a success.  On one hand there is the incredible performances of a gifted cast - Ron Moody being nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Fagin, and young Jack Wild's mature performance as the Artful Dodger.  Mark Lester plays Oliver, and depicts all the elements of innocence and vulnerability as could be imagined in the young boy.  Harry Secombe backs up the cast as the beadle, Mr Bumble.Perhaps the best aspect of the film though is the music itself.  Lionel Bart has done a masterful job in writing the original score, and you may expect to find yourself singing the songs for weeks after watching \"Oliver!\".  Here are the evergreens, \"Reviewing the Situation\", \"You've Got to Pick a Pocket Or Two\", \"Who Will Buy\", and the beautiful and touching \"Where is Love?\". The list of classic tunes goes on and on, and if nothing else, young people today should watch the film purely for its educational value - to be introduced to the sweet music of yesteryear, and to see that a film's qualities extend beyond the realms of special effects.\"Oliver!\" will rightfully go down as a classic film of its time, and with any luck will keep its place as a family favourite, for years to come.  Its warmth and familiar music make it a must-see.\n\n\n\n\n                31 of 36 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 186 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What are the three scenes inspired or taken from the Dickens' novel that were not in the stage version?\n\n\nQ:\n What makes this film different from Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\"?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 27 September 1968 (UK)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Oliver\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nShepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, England, UK\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$10,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Romulus Films, Warwick Film Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n153 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(35 mm optical prints)| 70 mm 6-Track\n(Westrex Recording System)\u00a0(70 mm prints)| 4-Track Stereo\n(Westrex Recording System)\u00a0(35 mm magnetic prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Among the traditions of the Jewish community, the matchmaker arranges the match and the father approves it. The milkman Reb Tevye is a poor man that has been married for twenty-five years with Golde and they have five daughters. When the local matchmaker Yente arranges the match between his older daughter Tzeitel and the old widow butcher Lazar Wolf, Tevye agrees with the wedding. However Tzeitel is in love with the poor tailor Motel Kamzoil and they ask permission to Tevye to get married that he accepts to please his daughter. Then his second daughter Hodel (Michele Marsh) and the revolutionary student Perchik decide to marry each other and Tevye is forced to accept. When Perchik is arrested by the Czar troops and sent to Siberia, Hodel decides to leave her family and homeland and travel to Siberia to be with her beloved Perchik....\nWritten by\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n tradition versus modernity\n|\n jewish\n|\n tradition\n|\n village\n|\n wedding\n|\u00a0See All (152)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nTo Life!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Marble dust was used to represent snow.

Sounds crazy, no? But here, in our little village of Anatevka, you might say every one of us is a fiddler on the roof trying to scratch out a pleasant, simple tune without breaking his neck. It isn't easy. You may ask 'Why do we stay up there if it's so dangerous?' Well, we stay because Anatevka is our home. And how do we keep our balance? That I can tell you in one word: tradition!\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    Topol and the cast sing \"Tradition\" without any opening credits rolling. At the end of the number, the fiddler, standing on the left of the screen, launches into an extensive solo while the opening credits roll on the right of the screen.

The world is so much poorer.

This is because the studio felt audiences would be turned away by a movie about living dolls. When Guitierrez brought up Toy Story (1995), he was met with blank stares.

Superb Animation\n\n                        19 October 2014 | by rgkarim\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nIt's October and it is usually the time for Halloween themed movies. Unfortunately for us, Halloween has been reduced to cheap horrors, or repetitive thrillers that are a bit of a bore. This year has been slightly different, but this reviewer would like the studios to go back in the past and pull some more seasonal themes to entertain us. Well, someone got my vibe, because my last review is on a film that captures the festive fun that Halloween is for the young and young at heart. So sit back my friends and catch my latest review on the animated feature The Book of Life. I'll start this review with talking about the story. The Book of Life has a fantastic tale that centers on the typical complication of a love triangle between characters Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana), and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Now we know the typical elements involved in this type of plot, but this film deviates from the typical and gives a little more pep around the story. From the start you get the backstory on each character, and the individual struggles they each face. Then they take these qualities and exploit them by bringing in the two masters of the underworld, who make a wager as to who will win the girl. The result of this wager, makes for an interesting romantic tale that is fun, emotional, and more realistic than half the dramas we get these days. However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. The story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. What else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered. Countless puns are shouted in ridiculous voices, often followed by a character face planting into an object. What's even better is that the comedy is also diverse and spread out instead of following the typical style of beating a joke to death, the exception being Joaquin's obsession with mustaches. In addition to the comedy, the music also brings some thing to the film. Most of the numbers are covers of famous songs, some done horribly to be funny and others that are very relevant to the plot. A couple of the original numbers made my emotions go on a ride, as happiness, sadness, and even love all came together in the instruments and voice. Now most won't find it as powerful as Frozen, but for this reviewer it was nice having the music around the movie, not the opposite way around. Aside from the singing, the voice acting is incredible, each of the cast capturing the essence of the stereotypical Mexican character. Now there are too many to write about so let me pick my three favorites. First is Christina Applegate, the girl has got sass, spunk, and compassion all at work in her tour guide character. The girls sells the story as she uses the wooden puppets, which are represented in the character design, to craft the tale, keeping the kids in line, and yet showing empathy. Then there was Zoe Saldana who has the feisty Mexican girl zest that shows everyone girls don't need men to save them. Her voice is suave and full of passion, and exactly the buffer needed amidst the rowdy, rough voices of the cast. Finally the Queen of the Dead was my favorite character, and Kate del Castillo does a nice job bringing the character to life with flare, kindness, and the ability to hold her own. What can you take away from my sporadic rambling? The Book of Life is one of the better animated films I've seen in a while. It's Halloween fun, with colorful worlds and characters that balance out the predictable and limited tale. I strongly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, possibly in 3-D.

Now Michael needs to up his game: learn how to ride a motorcycle and transform himself into Stephanie's hot leather-clad fantasy.

My parents argued with the issue, but I watched it on the \"Star Channel\" which became the Movie Channel later.  I immediately identified with Sandy--not just because of the accent, but because of the good-girl longing to break out role.Grease 2 came out, and I HAD to see it.  Mom had gotten me all the soundtrack songs from the first from the radio (the old tape-recorder and setting it alongside the radio, and I taped the 2nd movie's soundtrack the same way off the television.  I fell in love with Michael--he began to haunt my dreams.  As Cool Rider, he was so gorgeous, all that leather, and perfect.  Stephanie was a perfect compliment to him.  (Doesn't help much that I like Catwoman?)  I also liked Adrian Zmed.  I watched Bachelor Party tonight.  I didn't realize that Jay O'Neil was he!  It was when he same \"...Demon...\" that it brought back the memories of Grease.  The man sang great. Wonder why he didn't go into the business?  There was something about being in jr. high when this movie was out that added to the flavour of my perception (like Catsup).  I would have given anything for a Pink Ladies' reversible jacket.  (Another neat touch--I didn't know they reversed to black!)This was a wonderful comedy, as well as a great commentary about school-life in general.  And yes, I own a copy.  When I saw it at Giant Eagle last year, I had to grab it before it disappeared.  To me, it's that good.(I do admit that I've long been bothered though about Michael playing at the talent show after the jump though....)8 out of 10 stars!\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 19 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 330 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Besides Frenchy, do any of the original Grease gang appear in this movie?\n\n\nQ:\n Are Frenchy and Doody still together?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 11 June 1982 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Brilhantina 2\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nThe Pink Motel & Cadillac Jack's Diner, 9457 San Fernando Road, Sun Valley, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$13,200,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $4,645,411,\n13 June 1982 \n\nGross USA: $15,171,476        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $15,171,476        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Paramount Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n115 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n(35 mm prints)| 70 mm 6-Track\n(70 mm prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Metrocolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When the Magic Mirror proclaims Snow White the fairest one of all, she must flee into the forest, where she befriends the lovable seven dwarfs - Doc, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Sleepy, and Dopey. But when the Queen tricks Snow White with an enchanted apple and falling into a deep sleep, only the magic of true love's kiss can save her.\nWritten by\nLesley (from the back of the Snow White DVD) \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n dwarf\n|\n brothers grimm\n|\n fairy tale\n|\n evil stepmother\n|\n based on fairy tale\n|\u00a0See All (246)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA glorious new world of beauty, thrill and enchantment awaits you!

It is believed that this change was made to avoid offending either German-speaking or non-Christian movie-goers, neither of which demographic was viewed, at the time, as being able to identify with Christian monks.

On initial release, England banned the film from unaccompanied children under 16, while in Sweden, an unedited version of the film was not released until 1992, at which point it was okayed for children under seven years with a parent. In that country, it had been edited by eight minutes in the 1960s and four minutes in the 1980s, trimming Snow White's flight through the forest, the Queen transforming into the Witch, and the Seven Dwarfs chasing the Witch up the mountain.

It is a great film, but there are certain factors that make it so, and without them the film could've gone the other way and become important more for its technical breakthrough(s) than for the content. The fact is a story with the utmost simplicity like Snow White, the chief characters- Prince Charming, the wicked Queen/witch, and of course Snow White- are all very basic, simple, if not one dimensional than basely two-dimensional characters. It's appropriate, to be sure, as it is based off a Grimm fairy tale. Despite the beauty and charm of the early scenes, its really on par entertainment-wise with the Silly Symphonies Walt Disney produced in the 30's. This also goes without saying that Snow White's run through the woods is one of the highlights of the film, still bringing a sense of terror and the surreal for the adults in the audience (if you're a little kid it could be one of the scariest things you've ever seen). But then- just as Snow White settles into her little 'hide-out' in a house she thinks occupied by messy, orphaned children- we're introduced to the seven dwarfs, and this is where the film picks up most of its energy, laughs, and complete and total balance. In a way, not to analyze too deep for a filmed fairy tale, they each represent the different sides of men, and so it gives the film the appropriate human dimensions it needs (in this, also setting up practically all the hand-drawn Disney films of the next seventy years or so). It's tempting to say which are my favorite, or whom I got the most enjoyment out of. There would be three, two for more obvious reasons, one for subtle ones.Dopey, who is almost a perfect re-incarnation (in Disney Dwarf form of course) of Harpo Marx- he's a lovable idiot, with barely two sounds in the course of the film, who (and I hate to sound sappy) brings out the laughing kid in anyone. Grumpy, who I found to be maybe the most complete character in the film, has attitude to spare, and gets comic bit after comic bit happen to him from the animators- and yet, there is heart behind him, and when its revealed in key parts of the film, they act as the most emotional points. There is also Sleepy, who also barely says a word, but who's physical movements are really divine little moments among the big, inspired musical numbers. Indeed, there are little moments throughout the film that help make up the greatness: the mood and atmosphere in the Queen's dungeon of witchcraft; the scene where the dwarfs go to sleep (a fly that rests on Sleepy's nose); the traits given to the animals in the forest (that little turtle is hilarious).All these parts help to add to the basic structure of the story- Queen wants the good looks, goes after her once the hunter fails, gives her the poison apple, then it goes even more predictable from their (though in a good way). The detail of the animated scenes, the backgrounds, the visual effects, are often mesmerizing. And the songs, which were some of the most standard I heard from the Disney oeuvre as a kid (they were always on those Disney 'Sing-along' videos) are still whimsical most of the time. Then there is also the icing on the cake- the voice of Snow White, Adriana Caselotti (who got contracted into this being her only film role, based of producer/uncredited director Disney's insistence), brings something to the film that's hard to describe, except to say that it's, well, serene.Even if she's not the strongest character, her main goal of making people around her feel good and inspiring happiness makes her watchable, and in a way lovable. It's a very curious, though important, factor that she (and Prince Charming and the Queen pre-witch) are animated very traditionally, apart from the cartoon-like dwarfs and animals. Its a reminder of the film's, and Disney's, strongest success- that as an imagined and visualized fairy tale, the representation is strong, and touching. In the new century studios move away from hand-drawn animated films, but it's a good idea to look back to the early Disney films, if not for just nostalgia (or to watch with your kids) to get a sense of the experimentation, the purity of it. It remains one of only several animated films, from any country or style, to have the crucial elements come together- music, voice-talent, usage of colors, and cinematography.\n\n\n\n\n                17 of 17 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 276 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is the huntsman good, neutral or evil or reformed evil?\n\n\nQ:\n How does the evil Queen know where the dwarf's cottage was located?\n\n\nQ:\n Where are Snow White's real parents?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Disney [United States]\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 31 January 1960 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Shilgia VeShiv'at HaGamadim\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

I found it to me a movie that was so much fun to watch.Starts out live-action, than it seagues into stop-motion animation. Some of the scenes are very memorable (the pirate attack) and the voices are delightful.  Not as good as Nightmare Before Christmas, but every bit as imaginative.\n\n\n\n\n                19 of 30 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 99 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nDuring the fight that ensues after the archery tournament, Robin Hood shoves Prince John's throne off the platform onto the Sheriff's posse. Later, Little John in the \"runaway tent\" comes crashing through and hits the throne, which is now back in its original, upright position.

Well, we folks of the animal kingdom have our own version. It's the story of what really happened in Sherwood Forest.\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nOn the DVD version of the film, the opening credits are different. There are occasional pauses in the original animation where additional voice actor credits are inserted. This is not in the original release, or in the earlier VHS versions.

Then a couple of weeks ago I was discussing with my friend about animation movies and it came up that he had this important piece of my childhood on VHS. So of course I borrowed it and watched it for the first time in about 13 years. I remembered surprisingly many scenes.Watching this movie wasn't as big event as it was years ago, but I still find it quite enjoyable. There were some funny mistakes in the translation from English to Finnish, but nothing crucial. I think I'll watch this a couple of times again for the old times sake before I give the tape back to my friend. :) 8/10\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 11 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 182 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

I grew up during the Valley Girl era, only in a valley in Northern rather than Southern California. I leaned heavily towards the punk/post punk side of things, but I have fond memories of the more mainstream styles and music of that time. Seeing The Plimsouls playing in a club in a movie was a BIG DEAL to an 80's music nerd, as was hearing Bonnie Hayes, Sparks and Modern English when it was still rare to hear those types of bands on mainstream radio.But this movie just feels too far removed to really get how we were back then. The styling is just all wrong. Punks in the early 80's had really short and razor-styled haircuts. It was a radical departure from the long surfer mops and floppy mullets that your average dude was rocking back then. Short, tightly cut hair looked revolutionary back then. Some sloppily-dressed guy like the lead actor with messy, longish floppy hair would have been seen as a stoner, not a punk. Or maybe, they got the look confused with the grunge styles of a decade later. But punk? No way. Nic Cage wasn't 100% authentic either, but his hair was spot-on, and his style really set him apart from the preppy jocks.The casting of the original was so inspired. Nic Cage was just starting to step into his acting style, and he was sexy, and totally believable as the edgy guy who was an undercover hottie, and also possessed of a big heart and soul. But Deborah Foreman-she was so PERFECT. She had this luminous quality about her, with a lithe, delicate build, perfect 80's feathered hair, a very clean and fresh face with sparkling eyes, and a winsome sweetness and elegant poise and grace that made her totally believable as \"that girl\" that made Cage's character fall so incredibly hard. The girl in this remake just doesn't have the sparkle and ease that Foreman had in spades. And they made yet another styling error by spackling on the very 2020-style heavy, layered makeup. That's nowhere close to the preppy-Val look, which was very clean and minimal. And the hair? That was merely 2010s-style barrel-rolls that every overly made-up girl and celebrity of that time, laden with pounds of extensions, thought was a throwback to the 70's/80's feathered look. It's not even close. That's another big style difference-80's girls never wore extensions, fake eyelashes, fake tans, or fake bolt-on breasts. A lean, natural body, a tan actually from being outside on a California beach, and healthy, natural hair was how us 80's girls did things. If you were a punk girl, you probably chopped your hair into a spiky asymmetrical wedge, and fiddled around with bleach and dyes.I don't see the need to go on much more-this movie didn't need to be made. And whomever was in charge of the costume and makeup stylings really should have listened to someone who was actually around during that era.\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 15 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 94 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n may Christ bless you\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 8 May 2020 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Fata din vale\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nLos Angeles, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $7,671        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Sneak Preview Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Orion Classics \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n102 min\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

My younger brother showed me a clip of their song \"Business Time\" performed live and ever since I've been hooked. The show itself is truly hilarious, but what really makes it a true 10/10 is the music. With songs like Business Time, Robots, Beautiful Girl, Bowie, Leggy Blonde and many more this show will make you cry tears of joy. Not only are the duo of the band brilliant but they also have comedians Rhys Darby as their hilariously pathetic band manager Murray and Arj Barker as their friend and local pawn shop guy to teach them how things work in America.If you simply go over to Youtube and search for Flight of the Conchords you're bound to find an ample source of entertainment but trust me, watch the series as well; it is simply brilliant.\n\n\n\n\n                63 of 72 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 44 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Barrie's 1904 play\n\n                        13 December 2016 | by ma-cortes\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nThis classic contains adventures , imagination , astounding as well as gorgeous sets and brilliant images . The picture mingles action , feats , humor , tongue-in-cheek , fantasy and a lot of entertainment . The film centers about Peter Pan (voice by Bobby Driscoll) , a nice adolescent who doesn't want grow up , Wendy , and brothers , all of them form a motley group going to Neverland , the wonderful and enchanted island . As they are whisked away to the magical world of Neverland on a magical flight . Peter Pan , Tink and Lost Boys , a gang of rag-tag runaways (they were boys who fell out of their prams while the nurses weren't looking , whereas Peter Pan is a permanent resident of Never Neverland, the lost boys are only temporary lodgers , if they seem to grow up, Peter Pan sends them home) will take on captain Hook , Smee and pirates henchmen . Meanwhile , Pan fights enemies and attempts to save his friends from scheming Captain Hook , Smee and his hoodlums .The film contains emotion , humor , fantasy , a lot of fun and songs from Sammys Cahn and Fain . Here Peter and friends undertake several adventures in Neverland ; as Pan with the help of her and the Lost Boys battling Captain Hook and Smee . All ingredients are well presented and and correct and directors Clyde Geronimi , Wilfred Jackson , Hamilton Luske inject much excitement into the many boisterous action scenes . From the beginning to the end the amusement and entertainment is interminable . An entertaining movie that turns out to be colorful and delightful , though a little tiring when the characters are singing , but is still shines . The highlights film are the marvelous images when Peter Pan and Jane are flying throughout Neverland , as they fly over clouds , Tipis , Indian tribes and skull monument . Due to controversy over their appearance in this original movie , as Disney attracted negative comments for their stereotypical depiction of Indians, as indeed did J.M. Barrie with his original play . Marvelous and hilarious scenes carried out by the Disney animators , including extreme comic possibilities when happen \"Hook vs. the Crocodile\" , adding the unforgettable \" Tick Tock!\" sound heard from the crocodile. Although original author J.M. Barrie is credited , this film was the only major version of \"Peter Pan\" to use little of his original dialogue . A great cast of actors to be used to shoot this classy including Hans Conried (Hook) , Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan) , Bill Thompson (Mr. Smee) , Heather Angel (Mrs. Darling) , among others . Disney went on to exasperate purist fans (similarly to cartoon rendition \u00a8Alice in Wonderland\u00a8) using American boy star Bobby Driscoll's voice for Pan and modelling Tinkerbell on Marilyn Monroe . Many Peter Pan purists were very upset by the characterization of Tinker Bell as a petulant and voluptuous young woman as old film \u00a8Peter Pan\u00a8 as its sequel titled \u00a8Return to Never Land\u00a8 . The fable will appeal to adventure and classic tale fan . Rating : 8/10 above average . It's a terrific familiar amusement that will appeal to vintage tale fans .Other films and stage productions dealing with this classic personage are the followings : The original Broadway production of \"Peter Pan\", or \"The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\" by J.M. Barrie opened at the Empire Theater on November 6, 1905 , it ran for 223 performances, closed on May 20, 1906, and starred nineteenth-century stage actress Maude Adams, who never made any films ; silent film \u00a8Peter Pan\u00a8 (1924) starred by Virginia Brown Faire as Tinker Bell , it uses much of Barrie's original dialogue ; Peter Pan (1953) with voice by Bobby Driscoll, Kathryn Beaumont, Hans Conried ; \u00a8Hook\u00a8(2001) with Steven Spielberg with Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook , Robin Williams , Freddie Highmore , Julia Roberts , Bob Hoskins as Smee , Maggie Smith and Caroline Goodall ; \u00a8Finding Neverland\u00a8 (2004) by Marc Foster with Johnny Depp as James M Barry , Kate Winslet , Kelly McDonald as Peter Pan , Julie Christie , Radha Mitchell , and recent version \u00a8Peter Pan\u00a8 by JP Hogan with Jeremy Sumpter , Raquel Wood and Jason Isaac . And the official sequel to classic history with an enjoyable Peter Pan , \u00a8Return to Never Land\u00a8(2002) by Robin Budd and Donovan Cook , though it was originally planned as a direct-to-video release in which the protagonist of the story results to be Wendy's daughter and is set in London during World War II , she is abducted by Captain Hook and Peter Pan must come to the rescue in order to challenge his old enemy once again .\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 12 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 133 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n When and where was the world premiere of Peter Pan?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nAmerican Sign Language\n\n\nRelease Date: 9 April 1955 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: As Aventuras de Peter Pan\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

But how can you be cool when your dad's Goofy? Stage an impromptu concert at the final assembly, that's how! Or at least it sounded good until Principal Mazer found out. Goofy finds out about his son's antics (sort of), and decides a fishing trip, like his dad took him on, is the solution. Of course, he doesn't know that Max finally lands a date with Roxanne for a party thrown by the class valedictorian. Through the movie, Goofy tries to bring Max out of his shell, while Max resents being taken away, and lying to Roxanne about the trip (he tells her he & his dad will be appearing on TV at the PowerLine concert in LA). Will Max sink or swim? Will Goofy goof up his son's first shot at romance? Will Bigfoot step back? And what about those nuns?\nWritten by\nJoe Sewell <jsewell@iu.net> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n father son relationship\n|\n older actors younger roles\n|\n travel\n|\n singing in a vehicle\n|\n concert\n|\u00a0See All (278)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nIn The Most Hilarious and Hippest Animated Musical-Comedy Ever                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Donald Duck originally had a larger role where he played a travel agent.

This is a great children's film and can still relate to today's kids. The humor is enjoyable, the characters are lovable. The music is definitely bearable, whereas with most musical animated films the songs can really grate on the nerves. Perhaps it's just because I practically was raised on this film that I enjoy it so much, but I have given it to my little brother and he loves it as well. It's a great experience for any kid and shouldn't be missed. It's even a little fun for adults, and I am not ashamed to say I still enjoy it as well. A Disney classic! 10/10\n\n\n\n\n                49 of 50 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 136 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why didn't Goofy and Max confess to each other at the beginning of their trip?\n\n\nQ:\n At the end of 'A Goofy Movie', Max and Roxanne say they will go on a date, but it doesent happen in 'An Extremely Goofy Movie'.

'Nightmare' is both a horror film and a musical, and fantasy and a suspense film, and like most Burton effort, comedy is thrown in at just the right moments.  With Henry Selick as director and Michael McDowell & Caroline Thompson as the screenwriters, Burton has fashioned the worlds of Halloween-town and Christmas-town as real originals, working on the cliches that are in each holiday and surrounding the worlds with a host of terrific and terrifying characters.  While Halloween-town has a mayor (appropriately with two faces, one smiling one distressed), the real leader is Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon voices with a great Danny Elfman as the singing Jack) who orchestrates Halloween every year for its citizens.  But he's grown weary over the years, and after stumbling upon Christmas-town, loaded with good will towards men and a large man in a red suit, he gets his town riled up to overtake the joyous holiday.  Despite one protest by Sally (an amazing Catherine O'Hara), the doll-girl who loves him, the town goes on creating Jack's vision.  The results are hilarious and, indeed, spellbinding.Much credit is given to Burton and Selick for their work on the film, but a lot should also be attributed to Denise Di Novi (co-producer and co-designer), Rick Heinrichs (visual consultant), Pete Kozachik (D.P.), and of course Danny Elfman for his perfectly fitting score and song creations. Along with the talented voice actors, Nightmare Before Christmas ends up a triumph of artistic ingenuity.  Some could construe it as too weird or too stylish, but for the cult audience it has garnered over the past ten years it remains of of Burton's finest accomplishments.

Until Rudolf Nureyev's appearance in The Muppet Show: Rudolf Nureyev (1978), it was very difficult for the producers to find celebrities willing to appear on The Muppet Show (1976).

I'm not often one for musicals, but this one - aided by the brilliant combination of fuzzy puppet singers and Flight of the Conchords composition - hits all the right notes. It's funny without nudging into blue territory, a talent that's becoming more scarce by the minute, with a heartwarming reunion storyline that slowly reintroduces the cast and reminds us why we grew to love them in the first place. Loaded with unexpected cameos and sly winks at the troupe's long history, it's clear that a lot of love went into the making of this picture; the screen positively resonates from beginning to end. Though I was hesitant to revisit this old territory at first, by the final act I was grinning warmly and nodding right along, utterly entranced.\n\n\n\n\n                13 of 18 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 265 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Isn't that the plot of many other Muppet projects?\n\n\nQ:\n Who is Walter?\n\n\nQ:\n What is \"The Muppets\" about?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nUK\n|\nFrance\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 8 December 2011 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ha'habubot\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nSanta Barbara, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$45,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $29,239,026,\n27 November 2011 \n\nGross USA: $88,631,237        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $165,184,237        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Pictures, Mandeville Films, The Muppets Studio \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n120 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nSDDS\n| Datasat\n| Dolby Digital\n| Dolby Surround 7.1\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But when things go wrong at the wedding rehearsal, Victor goes into the woods to practice his vows. Just as soon as he gets them right, he finds himself married to Emily, the corpse bride. While Victoria waits on the other side, there's a rich newcomer that may take Victor's place. So two brides, one groom, who will Victor pick?\nWritten by\nXxCherrySodaxX \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n gothic horror\n|\n horror for children\n|\n bride\n|\n corpse\n|\n arranged marriage\n|\u00a0See All (125)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nCan a heart still break once it's stopped beating?                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some scary images and action, and brief mild language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nTim Burton: [distorted female face] Emily and other characters appear in varying stages of death and decay.

My mother and I are so happy that he made another beautiful and original animated film since The Nightmare Beofre Christmas because we waited for it for 10 years. I'm glad to say that the wait was worth it. The Corpse Bride is a wonderful emotional yet fun story with heart. We had a wonderful time watching it in the theaters and we can't wait to go see it again this weekend. The visuals are so amazing that you'd have to go see the movie with your own eyes for its impossible to explain there perfection. The characters all look stunning and there are so many wonderful new characters in this movie that will keep your eyes glued on the screen. The voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson are packed with fantastic emotion and acting. The score goes very well to the movie and the four songs that are performed sound wonderful. My favorites were \"Remains of the Day\" made me feel like dancing: it was such a jazzy fun song with the cool voice of Danny Elfmen. And my other favorite was \"Tears To Shed\" it broke my heart. Helena Bonham Carter sang that song with such heartbreak I loved it! The story is very entertaining and it has so much heart in it and Gothic like background. I loved the dialog some of my favorite lines were \"Why Go Up There When People Are Dying To Get Down Here\" and \"Can A Heart Still Break Once It's Stopped Beating.\" But the most important thing is that this movie makes you feel less frightened about death. Death in this movie is a lot funner than living and the dead are always having a good time and partying that you feel like dying is not so bad. You should take anyone to see this movie if their paranoid about death it will soften their fears, Overall I strongly encourage anyone to go see this movie. I hope Tim Burten wins the Oscar for best animated movie this year. He truly deserves it! Thank you Mr. Burten for the Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas and years worth of your great films.\n\n\n\n\n                90 of 124 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 544 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How did Emily die?\n\n\nQ:\n Is this a musical?\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'Corpse Bride' about?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Warner Bros [France]\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 24 November 2005 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: El cad\u00e1ver de la novia\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nEngland, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$40,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $388,166,\n18 September 2005 \n\nGross USA: $53,359,111        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $118,090,836        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Warner Bros., Tim Burton Productions, Laika Entertainment \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n77 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS-ES\n| Dolby Digital EX\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Beyond Bill and Linda, Selma has a small group of friends who look out for her, including her primary confidante, Kathy, with who she works, and Jeff who wants to be her boyfriend. Jeff regularly waits outside Selma's workplace long before the end of her shift to drive her home, despite she always refusing in not wanting to lead him on. Her primary job is working on the Anderson Tool factory assembly line, but she does whatever she can to earn money. What only Kathy knows among Selma's friends is that she is slowly going blind, her medical condition being genetic. Selma is barely able to see, just enough to do her job.

This film was an amazing view into the human mind as well as a tragic story of hopeless hope, betrayal by others, and still remaining true to yourself. Bjork produces an inspirational performance, of which one would never think she is not primarily an actress. Some of her moments in this film bring you to tears with their absolute honesty. The ensemble cast are a godsend as well. Peter Stormare, Catherine Denevue, and David Morse in particular. Morse, playing the most varied and difficult character, succeeds with apparent ease. The only complaint I had of the film is that it was slightly drawn out and slow paced. However, it is still spiked with moments of surprise that knock you so hard, you are pulled back in immediately. With an incredible closeness to these people, Dancer in the Dark will make you think and stretch your emotions to the limit.\n\n\n\n\n                58 of 88 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 731 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

This rockin' was supposed to be so much more than it lead on, but it really failed to deliver. I'm quite sad to say that Camp Rock may not be a failure to Jonas Brothers fans and teenage girls, though compared to other Disney Channel Movies, it just does not deliver.The story starts off with Michie Torres, a girl that desperately wants to attend a Rock and Roll camp, and subplots Joe Jonas being throw back into his old stomping grounds before he became the hotshot that he is in Connect 3.Right in, they establish the characters of Michie as the shy girl, and the rather rude Shane Gray. It seems that clich\u00e9 character development only kicks in after a few scenes, for little to no reason at all. The work done by the actors was relatively decent, with a few small exceptions. However, having to deal with a horrible script like Camp Rock, is a task in it's on. The film tries to create conflict with an enemy that nobody really cares about, or has any ill feelings for. The mark of good character development is to love your enemy. Perhaps Meaghan Jette Martin had a scene or two that was cut that really showed us that she had such feelings for her family.Camp Rock has all your normal stereotypical Disney children in it. Your hero(in), the hero's sidekick, other friends introduced for comedic value, the hero's enemy, and the enemies cronies. Disney does not fail to deliver an overdone plot of being ashamed of your family and how lying is bad. Blah blah blah... Girl lies, gets out casted, expresses remorse and sticks up for herself. Haven't seen this stuff in a Disney movie before! Nope, not me! Lastly, the music. Though it is somewhat strange that a rock star would be a hip hop teacher at a rock and roll camp, I found that it worked for the most part. Most of the songs are forgettable at best until the finale, as many musicals are. Though, these select songs make this movie re watchable and marketable for Disney. It will probably launch *a* career...I'm quite sure it's got to be just a big Jonas Brothers promotional video. I'm sure the funds raked in for this film will also be astronomical much like its musical counterpart, High School Musical.All in all, the story is boring and forgettable, but some of the songs you'll be singing to your self after seeing the film once or twice (or perhaps 20 or so, if you know Disney Channel). Watch this once, definitely, to see if it's your cup of tea. But it didn't quite do it for me the way HSM did it for the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\n                30 of 47 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 152 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why was Peggy called \"Margaret\" at the end of the movie?\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"We Rock\" a cover of the Dio song, \"We Rock\"?\n\n\nQ:\n How can I audition or find disney casting calls for Camp Rock 3?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            DisneyNOW\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nPortuguese\n\n\nRelease Date: 11 September 2008 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Camp Rock: \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044b\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nCamps White Pine & Towhee, Haliburton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Disney Channel, Sudden Motion Productions, Alan Sacks Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 HD\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There he meets Wimpy, a hamburger-loving man; Olive Oyl, the soon-to-be love of his life; and Bluto, a huge, mean pirate who is out to make Sweethaven pay for no good reason. Popeye also discovers his long-lost Pappy in the middle of it all, so with a band of his new friends, Popeye heads off to stop Bluto, and he's got the power of spinach, which Popeye detests, to bust Bluto right in the mush. Watch as Popeye mops the floor with punks in a burger joint, stops a greedy taxman, takes down a champion boxer, and even finds abandoned baby Swee'pea. He's strong to the finish 'cause he eats his spinach.\nWritten by\nDylan Self <robocoptng986127@aol.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n based on comic strip\n|\n sailor\n|\n spinach\n|\n abandoned baby\n|\n bully\n|\u00a0See All (125)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nHe's a man's man!

In 2012, Paramount licensed American/Canadian home video rights to much of its catalog to Warner Bros., and this film was among the titles that were licensed to them. Warner Bros. has owned the Fleischer/Famous \"Popeye\" cartoons outright since 1996.

Each time the shot switches perspective, one of the bottles keeps going from half full to completely full.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nQuotes\nNana Oyl:\nOh, my stars! A garden!

I haven't seen Popeye since it came out (I was only eight), but I surprisingly remembered almost all of it, including those dreadful songs.\nI have to agree with those of you describing the strangeness of this film (I was especially amused by the reviewer simultaneously conflicted and, seemingly, terrified by the creepiness!). But for those of you who are fans of the old Popeye cartoons & comic strips from the 1930s, you have to admit,however, that this movie is pretty darn faithful. This may be why it's so bizarre: it's a living cartoon. Bringing a cartoon to actual life usually takes away from the original's vibe, and creates a completely new, almost surreal, one through the attempt. It almost can't be avoided. Popeye's huge forearms, for example, are one thing in the comic - an exaggeration of workingman strength. Seeing them in real life is quite unnerving. Does this faithfulness make it a good film though? Odd, to be certain (almost fascinatingly so), but good?I was always a fan of those old black & white cartoons I grew up with,so I was REALLY excited to see this back in 1980. As a child, I clearly remember being disappointed and bored, except for a few fighting scenes. I like it now more, but like our conflicted reviewer friend, I'm not completely sure why. Robin Williams does a great job with Popeye's trademark always-mumbled-beneath-breath irreverent wisecracks (ad-libbed perhaps?). Shelly Duvall is downright perfection. Aloha Ray Walston! And then there are the songs....The late Harry Nilsson wrote some great stuff in his time, and had an incredible range and odd sense of humor. His music still permeates the movie world on a regular basis (\"Coconut\" from Reservoir Dogs, \"Jump Into the Fire\" from Goodfellas, Midnight Cowboy, You've Got Mail and, who could forget, the memorably annoying theme song to The Courtship of Eddie's Father). He was also, along with best friend & drinking buddy/sometime-collaborator John Lennon, known as quite the Wild Man. What was he thinking here? These songs have such a carelessness to them that some of them don't even seem like songs at all - they just kind of breeze in and breeze out. Lyrics are incredibly simplistic and repetitive. And I'm still not sure if Pappy's rant toward the end of the pic was intended as a \"number\" or not. But maybe this was what he was going for. Maybe Nilsson was experimenting with the musical format. Maybe he, like myself, had a hard time suspending disbelief when watching musicals, and finds it kind of weird and obtrusive when characters suddenly break into song and dance (you have to admit...the whole idea is pretty hard to swallow when you really think about it). Then again, maybe he was just losing it! This could've been the equivalent of a musical hangover. At the very least, as another reviewer mentioned, the songs DO ultimately have a catchiness that you can't quite escape. Who knows? Maybe this film will gain some cult appeal.Even though it was based on existing material, Popeye is definitely different! For that alone, it has to be worth something.

Indeed, only three songs were retained from the stage production, but the quality of those songs -- \"A Little Girl from Little Rock,\" \"Bye Bye Baby\" and \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" -- is head and shoulders above any others in the score, while the two numbers that were interpolated for the screen version by another songwriting team -- \"Ain't There Anyone Here for Love?\" and \"When Love Goes Wrong\" -- are both bona fide showstoppers. In all, there are only five numbers in the film -- each of which remain iconic-- as opposed to nineteen in the stage show, sixteen of which have been largely forgotten.

The story is thin and nonsensical. But that's OK, because the film's strengths lie in its comedic script, its dazzling musical numbers, and the inclusion of the visually stunning M. Monroe, as Lorelei Lee.Superficially, Lorelei \"seems\" like a not very bright \"babe\", especially in some of her comments. For example, she counsels Russell's character by saying: \"I want you to find happiness --- and stop having fun\". But there is a subtle quality about Lorelei that suggests that she may be smarter than she lets on. One wonders if Monroe, who was quite intelligent and bookish in real life, was really acting in this film, or just being herself.While there are several lively, and memorable, musical numbers, they are all lead-ins to the lavish, eye-popping musical finale. On a stage adorned in garish colors (orange, pink, and black mostly), a breathtakingly glamorous Monroe belts out the popular song: \"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend\". Her singing (partially dubbed) is not quite as credible as the performance of Carol Channing in the Broadway version. Still, the film's finale is a cinematic spectacle, a veritable feast for the eyes and ears. \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" is not a heavy weight \"message\" film. It is instead a pleasant and entertaining bit of fluff, where the emphasis is on fun, music, and glamour.\n\n\n\n\n                42 of 58 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 163 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is there a Cinemascope version of the 'Diamonds' Number?\n\n\nQ:\n Was Marilyn Monroe a natural blonde?\n\n\nQ:\n Is the song 'Down Boy' a deleted number and where was it deleted from?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: August 1953 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Gvarim Madifim Blondiniot\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMGM Studio Borehamwood London, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$2,260,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $648        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Twentieth Century Fox \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n91 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(Western Electric Recording)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And winning the coveted Tony as Best Musical, which is the ultimate goal, is even more difficult. Such trials and tribulations are shown for a handful of shows, their creative teams and their performers. There is competition amongst the performers for roles, competition amongst the shows not only for box office but also limited investor dollars and that final Tony prize, and competition amongst those ultimately hired in the cast and crew for what they want to see happen in the show, both for the good of the show and their own personal benefit. And sometimes, personal life gets in the way of these professional goals. These problems not only happen for those new or working their ways up the ranks, such as performers Karen Cartwright and Ivy Lynn, and the writing team of Jimmy Collins and Kyle Bishop, but also seasoned veterans, such as the writing team of Tom Levitt and Julia Houston, womanizing director Derek Wills, and producer ...\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n dreamworks\n|\n broadway\n|\n producer\n|\n director\n|\n chorus\n|\u00a0See All (20)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nFollow your dream.

The characters are also very complex which I love, you never know what one of them is going to do nextI never realised before how amazing Debra Messing is until this show, her acting is fantastic, and Megan Hilty is such a star. Any comparisons to Glee are simply because they both involve music, however they focus on entirely different things, SMASH is very mature and will easily appeal to an older audience, glee however is for teens and kids (like me, I love glee!) but this show is much more dramatic.I watched the whole of series 1 in 2 days and as soon as I finished it I wanted to watch it again, which is exactly what I did!\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 10 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 54 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Without much money, he plans on making a living teaching English while living in an inexpensive rooming house, where he befriends another of the tenants, American Sally Bowles. She is outwardly a flamboyant, perpetually happy person who works as a singer at the decadent Kit Kat Klub, a cabaret styled venue. Sally's outward fa\u00e7ade is matched by that of the Klub, overseen by the omnipresent Master of Ceremonies. Sally draws Brian into her world, and initially wants him to be one of her many lovers, until she learns that he is a homosexual, albeit a celibate one. Among their other friends are his students, the poor Fritz Wendel, who wants to be a gigolo to live a comfortable life, and the straight-laced and beautiful Natalia Landauer, a Jewish heiress. Fritz initially sees Natalia as his money ticket, but eventually falls for her. However Natalia is suspect of his motives and cannot ...\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n bisexual man\n|\n decadence\n|\n cabaret\n|\n nazi\n|\n nazism\n|\u00a0See All (142)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA divinely decadent experience!

Liza and her father modeled the visual look of Sally Bowles upon Jazz Age flapper icons such as Louise Brooks and Colleen Moore. In a 2006 interview, Liza recalled that she had asked her father, \"Should I be emulating Marlene Dietrich or something?\" And he replied, \"No, study everything you can about Louise Brooks.\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nBrian is seen pushing a bicycle while walking with Sally. The front light on the bicycle points downwards. Later, Brian and Sally join two friends for a cycle ride. Brian rides the same bicycle with the downward pointing light. In the same scene, when the four are pushing their bicycles and eating ice creams, Brian is pushing a bicycle that doesn't have the downward-pointing light.

Every time I watch it, it bewilders me so I can't turn my eyes away from the screen, even though I remember all what happens by heart. It fills me with a strange mixed feeling of interest-sympathy-admiration-disgust-and-horror. One of the reviewers here called this film depressing, and I inclined to agree. Any picture of Berlin in 1931 must be depressing and frightening. But, on the other hand, there is an atmosphere of desperate reckless joy in the movie. When the entire world goes mad and speeds to a catastrophe, life is a cabaret! Do what you can, come hear the music play, don't permit some prophet of doom wipe every smile away, and end as the happiest corpse! It's one idea. There is also another, more humanistic: live and let live. Brian fails to understand Sally, so they fall apart. Fritz for the sake of his love faces the danger of admitting that he is Jew in Germany. There is no hope for him and Natalia in this country in this time. But he couldn't do otherwise. There are plenty of other ideas too: about money, politics, corruption, perverseness, decadence, stupidity of middle classes, talent, success, etc. The story is very simple and incredibly complicated in the same time. No use retelling it. It must be seen. It's life as it was in 1931 and in many ways as it is nowadays. I suppose that Cabaret would be a great film even without any musical numbers, but with them it is a masterpiece. They say that history repeats itself, for the first time as a tragedy, for the second time as a farce. Well, I would say that in Cabaret every event repeats itself for the first time as a human drama in life and for the second time as a farce on the stage, but it would not be exactly true. Life and farce are shown synchronically or farce even go in advance. But every staged number in divinely decadency Kit Kat Klub ruthlessly shows the naked truth of life. (Only Mein Herr and Maybe This Time have more to do with the character of Sally Bowles.) And of course, Tomorrow Belongs To Me must be mentioned separately. The way of German people towards fascism is presented in one startling scene. And in finale too. That distorted reflection of the audience full of Nazi, accompanied by a tense silence after Master's of Ceremonies \u0091Aufwiedershen' is horrible. The movie due half of its unforgettable effect to the masterful camera shots. Actors' works are absolutely fantastical. Surely, Master Of Ceremonies is Joel Grey star role. He is amazing as that demonic shameless figure that seems to know everything, understand everything and deride everything. Liza Minnelli shines in every scene, acting, speaking, singing and dancing. I know few performances equally true, strong, brilliant and stylish as hers as Sally Bowles. Michael York is excellent as well, though he is often underestimated. It's only his character who is reserved, intelligent and avoids show-off. And he is perfectly British. I really admire York's acting in the movie. There are also beautiful Marisa Berenson as noble Natalia, Fritz Wepper very believable as tormented Fritz, repulsively attractive Helmut Griem as the rich scoundrel Maximilian and picturesque supporting cast. John's Kander's music is wonderful and haunting. Shortly, Cabaret is a work of a genius, or it would be better to say of geniuses: Bob Fosse and the crew and the cast. And it's flawless.\n\n\n\n\n                53 of 69 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 206 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is the meaning behind the angry looks that Max gives to Brian as Brian gets out of the car?\n\n\nQ:\n Where was the movie shot?\n\n\nQ:\n In the 'Tomorrrow Belongs to Me' scene, why does the old man look annoyed?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGerman\n|\nHebrew\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 13 February 1972 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Cabaret\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nBiergarten, Bavaria, Germany\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$4,600,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Allied Artists Pictures, ABC Pictures, A Feuer and Martin Production \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n124 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But instead of departing on the pickup truck, he jumps on his motorbike and leaves, leaving his luggage behind.\nAs they are loading the luggage in the truck, his cousin says \"I'll drive down on Saturday\" obviously meaning that he will deliver the luggage to Johnny then.

It's about the magnetic connections and tension between the characters, the swagger and desire, innocence and curiosity, and pushing the boundaries of the 1980s movies. Simply put, the magic is missing. The vibe, the joy, the heartache - none of it is there. Sometimes, remaking a classic movie is the WRONG move. When they get it right the first time....leave it alone! No need to waste three hours watching this film.\n\n\n\n\n                109 of 119 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 254 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

But check it out I did, and I've been hooked ever since.I can't describe why this show is so good in adequate terms, but I'll try to sum it up: Great animation, amazing characterization, clever writing, and an overall premise that works on all levels. Kids will love it, adults will love it, it's a great show for everyone- Young and old, male and female.What makes this show work so well is, again, that there's something for fans of any age or gender. The show isn't dumbed down or patronizing, but rather treats its audience with respect and delivers intelligent writing and plots. At the same time, it's simple enough to be understood and appreciated by even the youngest of viewers. Something like this doesn't come along often, making Friendship is Magic a treat for animation fans.My recommendation is to look past the genre (\"Little girls show\") and give the show a chance for what it is- An amazing cartoon that stands to be the best animated series of the decade, and one of the best in quite some time at that.\n\n\n\n\n                137 of 172 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 179 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why is there such a fan following of teenage and grown men for this girl's cartoon?\n\n\nQ:\n Is it true that an episode has been censored?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Discovery Family [United States]\n    \n|\n\n            Disney Channel [Japan]\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nCanada\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 10 October 2010 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: HaPoni haKatan Sheli: Chaverut Hi Kesem\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nVancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Allspark Animation, DHX Media, Hasbro Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n22 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 HD\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

After escaping the disturbing Queen of Hearts (Jayne Meadows), she finds that she has ended up on the other side of the looking glass in Looking Glass Land and that there is a mind-created Jabberwocky (Tom McLoughlin) after her. With the advice of a wise owl and royal chess pieces on her mind, she ventures home, vowing to grow up in this two-part movie which remains most faithful to the original stories written by Lewis Carroll.\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n alice character\n|\n alice in wonderland\n|\n alternate dimension\n|\n caterpillar character\n|\n the mad hatter character\n|\u00a0See All (139)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Complete Two-Part Story                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nShelia Allen was Producer Irwin Allen's wife making a cameo appearance.

I read other comments and some people said the same exact thing I did. My copy was either taped over or thrown out, a blessing in disguise. I was glad to see Warner has the rights and actually sells it on Amazon! I will admit that if you did not watch this movie when it first aired on CBS back in christmas of '85 that you might not like it nearly as much as I did and still do. I honestly still know the songs even though I have not seen it since probably the late eighties. I was 7 years old when this first aired and my mom taped it for me and my sister. I even remember there was an electrical storm that night in Los Angeles so my copy had interference from the lightning! Anyways, I would watch this tape all the time as a youngster. I think I watched it at least 25 times as a kid. I have not seen the 1999 version that aired on NBC, but I don't think that one would be quite as memorable as this one was. The cast were all well known celebrities, most of whom have either passed on or are no longer considered to be popular any longer. I give the story a 9. The visual design of the make up, costumes and sets gets a 10. The music gets an 8. And the acting and directing a 7. I give this movie an 8 overall. I am going to wait and see if Warner will release this on DVD.

He convinces Milly to marry him that same day. They return to his backwoods home. Only then does she discover he has six brothers - all living in his cabin. Milly sets out to reform the uncouth siblings, who are anxious to get wives of their own. Then, after reading about the Roman capture of the Sabine women, Adam develops an inspired solution to his brothers' loneliness.\nWritten by\nMelissa Portell <mportell@s-cwis.unomaha.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n farm\n|\n barn\n|\n cook\n|\n marriage\n|\n 1850s\n|\u00a0See All (252)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nMGM's love-making musical!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\u00a0|\n Western\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The seven brothers and their brides are: Adam & Milly, Benjamin & Dorcas, Caleb & Ruth, Daniel & Liza, Ephraim & Martha, Frank & Sarah, and Gideon & Alice.

The slapping of newborns originated in Victorian England when the sedation given to the mother also passed to the baby. The stimulation of the slapping is what caused the baby to take its first breath.

The CinemaScope version is the one generally screened, but both are available. The main difference between the two versions is a slight difference in angles, some minor differences in sound clarity and finally the \"flat\" widescreen version features more camera movement in order to capture all the action. Warner Brothers has released a 2-DVD set of this film containing both of these versions.

Leslie Caron is perfectly cast as the homeless orphan who falls in with a circus troupe and becomes part of their puppet act, only to fall in love with the embittered puppet master. In the end, the lovers get together after Lili (Leslie Caron) gets to display her ballet dancing talents.\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 18 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 60 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Joe's professional and personal lives are intertwined, he a chronic philanderer, having slept with and had relationships with a series of dancers in his shows, Victoria Porter, who he hired for the current show despite she not being the best dancer, in the former category, and Kate Jagger, his current girlfriend, in the latter category. That philandering has led to relationship problems, with Audrey during their marriage, and potentially now with Kate who wants a committed relationship with Joe largely in not wanting the alternative of entering the dating world again.

People just don't break into song-and-dance numbers in the course of their daily lives. Unless they are Bob Fosse, when suddenly doing so not only makes sense, but makes you wonder how we can go through life NOT singing and dancing.What this movie is, is simple: Bob Fosse unveiling his life, his knowledge, and a detailed explanation of his creative process, for future generations to evolve. This film is part biography, part self-exploration, and part legacy. It is the \"legacy\" part that is overlooked by almost everyone. If you ever dreamed of becoming a choreographer, this is the ideal place to start, because you'll watch, over and over, as Joe Gideon (Roy Schieder as the fictionalized Fosse) puts his stamp on a dance number, a process so unique and brilliant that it could easily be classified as its own form of dance rather than a subset of modern dance. If three words could sum up Fosse's style of choreography it would be \"make it sexier.\" Then make it even sexier. Then, when you're done, you need to make it even sexier. The \"Airotica\" number exemplifies this, and served as the inspiration for Paula Abdul's \"Cold Hearted\" video.The movie brings Fosse's inner circle and personal life to the screen, pulling absolutely no punches. Some call this film a form of narcissism, but it's hard to see how a man looking for self-given glory would portray himself falling apart physically and personally, the years obviously having taken a toll, as well as the emotional baggage that comes with abandoning family life (and a brilliantly played daughter by Erzsebet Foldi, in what would be her only film before she retired) for a girlfriend with some side dishes for variety. The women hate Gideon's infidelity, but love the man so dearly they know not to question or challenge it.Throughout the film, we are treated to vignettes that comprise the mosaic that is the life of Fosse. Metaphors abound, and the music blends effortlessly into a film that can make two hours seem like two minutes. This is not a film that could have been written and will not be enjoyed by those of simple intellects. So much of the plot exists in the abstract, and it is up to the viewer to find what is often an incredibly subtle symbolism. Simply put, this is a well-constructed film. Fosse's ex-wife and dance prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Ann Reinking, auditioned for (!) and won the part based on her, while the supporting cast includes many solid names, even a young John Lithgow as Lucas. Fosse's daughter makes a cameo in the film, as does the film editor. The comedian who appears as the subject of a movie is based on Lenny, a previous Fosse film.Joe Gideon is what everyone should be no matter what they do: someone who doesn't copy others, but develops their own vision and then methodically, sometimes maniacally, makes it happen. He lives in the moment, and squeezes everything he can out of each moment. This is evidenced by Gideon's brilliant work, but also by his rapidly deteriorating health caused by living in the party moments as well as the serious ones.The ending number is for the ages, putting a spin on the sappy endings that musicals are famous for.Your life is lacking until you have seen this film. That it did not win the Best Picture Oscar for its year was an absolute tragedy. It is one of the five best films of all time.\n\n\n\n\n                43 of 47 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 176 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Their plan goes bad and the rogues end up lost at sea after several misfortunes. Oddly enough, they end up on the shores of El Dorado, and are worshipped by the natives for their foreign appearances.\nWritten by\nPaolo Costabel <paolo@bluesky-vifx.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n cult film\n|\n adventurer\n|\n implied sex\n|\n five word title\n|\n 2d animation\n|\u00a0See All (62)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThey came for the gold... they stayed for the adventure        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for mild thematic material and language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nKevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh appeared in Wild Wild West (1999).

The story seems a bit rushed, but it is entertaining.  And the animation simply breathtaking.  The soundtrack is another winner for Elton John and the songs he performs add depth to the story.\n\n\n\n\n                13 of 15 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 175 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

However, Mumble has an astute talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap dancing. Though Mumble's mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his dad, Memphis, says it \"just ain't penguin.\" Besides, they both know that, without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange \"hippity- hoppity\" ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble's cool dance moves and invite him to party with...\nWritten by\nAnthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n anthropomorphic penguin\n|\n singing animal\n|\n singing penguin\n|\n penguin\n|\n emperor penguin\n|\u00a0See All (123)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe only film that has people dancing in the aisles                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some mild peril and rude humor\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    All of the dancers in the film had to go through \"Penguin School\" to capture the movements of penguins.

This film is a great family film that has complex messages. It is in musical form.When it begins we learn what happened to Mumble, that makes him tap dance and not sing. His father is ashamed of him, but his mother is not. As he grows, he looks different from the other penguins. Later, he mets Spanish - like penguins that are a hight light to the film because they add to the humor. As the story goes on, we learn there are less fish and the water is filled with garbage. Because of us humans, penguins are in danger.The characters are all great and the animation is wonderful and very detailed. It is funny and it even has messages. It teaches us to accept who we are. It also tells us that the environment is in danger, but in a fun and entertaining way. This film beats Monster House and Cars as the best animated film of the year.\n\n\n\n\n                18 of 33 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 595 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is the adolescent penguin at the end the offspring of Mumble and Gloria?\n\n\nQ:\n Are the short penguins hispanic?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Warner Bros.

From the opening scene, you know what that message is and where this story is going. And that's the point. While some of the jokes don't quite land and the movie seems to run just a bit longer in spots than necessary, Rebel Wilson does her usual comedic best to carry the film. A final twist plainly smacks the viewer with the moral of the film and finally concludes predictably. While muddled in spots, love the message of the film and had some fun.\n\n\n\n\n                24 of 41 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 433 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Everything is perfectly fine until an unwanted guest appears, the evil fairy Maleficent. Maleficent curses the young princess and announces that she will die by pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel before sunset on her 16th birthday. Fortunately, one of the good fairies, Merryweather, changes the spell so Aurora will fall into a deep sleep instead, and the only way to wake her from her sleep is true love's kiss. Finally the day comes.\nWritten by\nPat Conolly \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n fairy\n|\n castle\n|\n magic\n|\n forest\n|\n fairy tale\n|\u00a0See All (173)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nOne of the World's best loved stories becomes Walt Disney's Newest, Most Wonderful Motion Picture!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Was re-released in the US in 1970, 1979 and 1986. It was also re-issued in a few European countries in 1995. It was originally supposed to be re-released in America in 1993 as promoted on the 1992 VHS of Beauty and the Beast (1991), but no further evidence existed of these plans and was most likely to have been canceled by Disney.

This would be the proper styling for a prince or princess, but not for a king, who would be styled \"His royal majesty\".

Many years they had longed for a child, and finally their wish was granted. A daughter was born, and they called her Aurora. Yes, they named her after the dawn, for she filled their lives with sunshine. Then a great holiday was proclaimed throughout the land, so that all of high or low estate could pay homage to the infant Princess. And our story begins on that most joyful day...\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    The opening credits say Technirama, but not Super Technirama 70, which is the process it was filmed in.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nAt one point, the Swedish version was slightly edited to remove Prince Phillip hitting the Dragon's snout with his sword, as it was deemed too violent for Swedish children and also not motivated enough. It was eventually restored.

A perceived slight by a king and queen enrages a sorceress who casts an evil spell on the child that will take effect on her sixteenth birthday. Only her prince charming's kiss can save the girl from an unhappy fate and the frightening Maleficent stops at nothing to locate the princess in order to bring her prophecy to fruition. There are several pitched battles between the prince and the fairies against the forces of evil that accelerates into an exciting combat at the finish. The picture is bathed in beautiful color and the music of Tchaikowsky's ballet serves as a wonderful musical accompaniment.\n\n\n\n\n                32 of 39 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 201 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

At once gritty, whimsical and highly theatrical, the story moves from high schools and universities in Massachusetts, Princeton and Ohio to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the Detroit riots, Vietnam and the dockyards of Liverpool. A combination of live action and animation, the film is paired with many songs by The Beatles that defined the time.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n song\n|\n protest\n|\n artist\n|\n near death experience\n|\n vietnam war\n|\u00a0See All (442)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThey lived without rules.

Sadie is even seen drinking directly from a Jack Daniels bottle during her downward spiral, an action that Janis did regularly with Southern Comfort. Even Janis' throaty singing voice is used by Sadie in the movie.

Also, it would be way too cold to be driving around with the top down in a convertible.

She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry. Still, you don't regret a single day. Aw, girl. Girl...\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nThe Blu-ray edition omits when the one police officer says \"No one else is allowed up there.\" after allowing the rest of the gang to stay on the roof of the building. This can lead to confusion as to why Lucy wasn't allowed to go up after realizing Jude was up there.

What's more, though they did record the songs in studio first as part of the rehearsal process, most of the song performances used in the film were recorded live as they played out the scenes. Perhaps that's why - for me - the songs worked so well; it actually felt like the characters were just moved to sing. Amazing performances from - mainly - unknown actors.And I felt the story had a strong narrative line, aided / supported by the songs. It used the background of history, not just as a painted backdrop, but to add meaning and depth to the characters and the story they were living. Made me wish I'd been there (born in '65, too young to remember the 60's); I'll have to content myself with living vicariously through Jude and Lucy and the others.Add to everything else Julie Taymor's glorious visuals, and I was truly swept away. I saw 36 films at the festival, but this was head and shoulders my favourite.I fell in love with this film, and look forward to sharing it with friends and family who didn't have the luck to see it as I did. It's a film that will, I'm sure, reward repeated viewings.\n\n\n\n\n                310 of 410 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 560 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What songs are featured in this film?\n\n\nQ:\n Where did the character's names come from?\n\n\nQ:\n Are there any other Beatles references in this movie?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            sony Pictures [United States]\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 1 November 2007 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: A trav\u00e9s del universo\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMuseum of the City of New York - 1220 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$45,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $667,784,\n16 September 2007 \n\nGross USA: $24,602,291        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $29,625,761        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Revolution Studios, Gross Entertainment, Team Todd \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n133 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nSDDS\n| Dolby Digital\n| DTS\n| Dolby Atmos\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Subsequently, two \"improved\" versions of the soundtrack have been released by the Sony label: a 1988 CD in mostly true stereo; and a 2004 deluxe package containing a second, unused Judy Garland rendition of \"It's a New World\"; the singing commercial on TV for Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo; the discarded chorus of \"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\" (Judy with Jack Baker) from the \"Born in a Trunk\" sequence; the full orchestral introduction to \"Gotta Have Me Go with You\" (Judy with Don McKay and Jack Harmon); the complete orchestral introduction, not totally heard in the release print, to the Academy Award-nominated Garland trademark, \"The Man That Got Away\"; and musical director Ray Heindorf's Oscar-nominated background score, including portions not included in the finished picture.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nThe opening scenes of cars arriving for the benefit combine actual shots of a Hollywood event with ones filmed for the movie. But in one shot, taken from the perspective of a spotlight crew atop their tower, the footage of the real event is shown on the right side of the screen, while footage shot for the movie is at the left. Not only is the disparity between the two shots obvious, but the split screen is completely mismatched, so that the cars on the right appear to be moving at a sharp angle directly into the cars and building in the shot at left, and it looks as though there are two streets intersecting below.

After its second post-premiere - the very next day - two scenes of 15 minutes total were deleted; making the film run its original world debut length at 181 minutes. One was a number called \"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\" that came after Judy's take of \"I'll Get By\" in the 'Born in the Trunk' sequence, the other was a scene where Garland and James Mason's characters (Vicki and Norman) were picnicking on the beach; production stills and promotional advertisements are the only thing left in existence of the footage. After its world premiere on September 29, 1954, 27 minutes was cut, bringing it down to a mediocre 154 time length. Those scenes were:\n1) Esther quitting the band2) The Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo3) Esther working at a drive-in4) Norman being driven away drunk in his car5) Norman inquiring Esther's old landlady6) Spotting Esther on the TV commercial7) Tracking down Esther at her new boarding residence8) Driving down the strip - Esther getting sick9) \"Here's What I'm Here For\" musical number - Norman proposes10) \"Lose That Long Face\" musical number - Vicki breaks down See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nConnections\n        Referenced in Show Offs: No Veggies in Sight\u00a0(2019)\n\n\n        See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nSoundtracks\nI'll Get By (As Long as I Have You) \n(uncredited) \nMusic by Fred E.

James Mason gives an Oscar caliber performance as well and I believe in almost any other year that he wasn't up against Brando's \"On the Waterfront\" performance he would and should have won.  This George Cukor film features gorgeous color and beautiful cinematography, but does suffer from choppy editing that may be the result of restored footage.  The project to restore over an hour of missing footage scrapped by the producers after the original length was in excess of four and a half hours may have been done with the best intentions, but is still incomplete and leaves the film disjointed and obviously lacking.  I certainly wish the original footage was never scrapped, but this spotty attempt at restoration makes you feel like your watching more of a project than a classic film. Sometimes less is more and definitely in this case.  Whatever you do make sure you see the widescreen version of this film that was originally shot in Cinemascope or you will only see about a third of the actual picture and I assure you, you won't want to miss any of it.\n\n\n\n\n                22 of 27 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 165 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'A Star is Born' about?\n\n\nQ:\n What is Norman Maine's real name?\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"A Star Is Born\" based on a book?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 16 October 1954 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Nace una estrella\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nLancaster Hotel - 121 N.

Blue is a dog who always wants to do something but Steve never knows what. Steve interacts with the viewers through the television and they play Blue's clues, to see what Blue wants to do.\nWritten by\n<Justinrh@hotmail.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n surrealism\n|\n breaking the fourth wall\n|\n preschool\n|\n puppetry\n|\n animal character name in series title\n|\u00a0See All (17)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nTo empower, challenge and build the self-esteem of preschoolers...all while making them laugh!        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Co-creator Traci Paige Johnson voices Blue because out of her crew workers (they had no money to hire voices yet), she can bark more like a dog.

Several changes were:\nThe host was neither Steve or Joe. Instead a new character named Kevin (played by Kevin Duala) was given the role. He appeared in all episodes and wore both outfits the aforementioned American hosts wore.Three characters have their names changed. Shovel and Pail are instead referred to as Spade and Bucket, Mailbox is now called Postbox.Some song lyrics were changed with \"British English\" terms used in lieu of American English terms.Periwinkle's gender is changed. In the US version, Periwinkle is a boy, however in the English version, his gender is changed to a female.

In some shows mathematical concepts, such as shapes and relative weights are covered. Others introduce concepts in art and music, or general skills, like determining the proper order in which to do things in a step by step process.  Still others emphasize behavioral issues: responsibly caring for pets, dealing with fears, frustration, and frustrating individuals, to name a few.Steve, the sole live action individual in the show, is a warm, non-threatening individual who manages to project a gentle enthusiasm without sounding sappy and saccharine. I was sorry to read that Steve Burns intends to leave the show, but can understand it for myself.  There must be some point where one would want to throttle someone if forced to sing \"We just got a letter!\" one more time.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 8 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 33 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Barkin (Burt Reynolds), a rascally German Shepherd with a shady past, breaks out of the New Orleans Dog Pound with the help of his faithful friend Itchy (Dom De Luise), a nervously hyperactive dachshund. He then makes tracks to reunite with his gambling casino partner Carface Malone (Vic Tayback), a shifty pitbull who has planned a dastardly, and potentially deadly, double cross. Suddenly, Charlie finds himself at the Pearly Gates, face to face with the Heavenly Whippet (Melba Moore). Charlie weasels his way back to earth and reunites with Itchy. He plots his revenge against Carface and, along the way, acquires help from a little girl named Anne-Marie (who can talk to animals). After a series of fiendish schemes, close scrapes and unexpected adventures, both Charlie and Anne Marie find their lives at stake. Only one can be saved and the outcome is in Charlie's paws...\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n dog\n|\n heaven\n|\n revenge\n|\n animal\n|\n orphan\n|\u00a0See All (288)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nBut not all dogs stay there!        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The first Don Bluth film to have a PG rating in the UK.

A scene featuring Carface and the heavenly whippet shows Carface stealing his own watch as Charlie did, with the whippet chasing him. Charlie appears, and coyly says, \"He'll be back\", and winks at the camera.

I will always give it credit for being better than most of Don Bluth's later work. First, let's look at the positives. The animation is as good as any other Don Bluth film. Second, the voices are great and this is probably Dom DeLuise at his most entertaining voice. Third, this movie really does seem to tackle some interesting topics. I simply love the scenes where Charlie's in Heaven and we get to see this great place in all its detail. It really does have an interesting spiritual tone to it.There seem to be few movies about going to Heaven. Unfortunately, there were a lot of awkward parts. There were simply too many songs and a lot of them weren't that good. It's really weird with how scenes of the well, big lipped alligator, although I guess he does technically have relevance to the plot as he appears more at the end. I was disappointed that they didn't show Heaven more. The dog angel was probably the most entertaining character in the film and I really did want to see more of that world. I guess this was just an okay film from Don Bluth, but I encourage people to watch it and get their own opinion. **1/2\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 7 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 108 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What's the song during the credits?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            MGM\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nIreland\n|\nUK\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 17 November 1989 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Todos los perros van al cielo\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nSullivan Bluth Studios - Phoenix House, Conyngham Road, Northside, Dublin, Ireland\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$13,800,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $4,712,834,\n19 November 1989 \n\nGross USA: $27,100,027        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $27,100,027        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Goldcrest Films International, Sullivan Bluth Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n84 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n| Dolby SR\n(1994 Re-Release)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.66 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The story centers around Mark and Roger, two roommates. While a former tragedy has made Roger numb to life, Mark tries to capture it through his attempts to make a film. In the year that follows, the group deals with love, loss, AIDS, and modern day life in one truly powerful story.\nWritten by\nAlex W \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n junkie\n|\n drugs\n|\n drug use\n|\n injection\n|\n smack the drug\n|\u00a0See All (301)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nLove.

In the editing room the scene was shelved. Additionally \"Goodbye, Love\" another emotional scene primarily focused on Dawson was also shelved. Upon release of the film Dawson's manager and lawyer contacted Colombus about cutting 'Dawsons' most powerful scenes' and were upset on the opportunities this may have cost her. The director gave his excuse that the first scene was cut in favor of a more \"storytelling\" scene of Mimi with Benny and the second was cut to maintain the emotional punch of the ending. Though Dawson's representation disagreed, no further legal action pursued. \"Goodbye, Love\" can be viewed on the two disc CD, whereas \"Without You\" remains shelved.

That became evident when we saw the movie version the other day. There were a lot of young people in groups that came to see what director Chris Columbus did to the musical that is still running on Broadway after nine years. The screen adaptation is by Steve Chbosky.\"Rent\", written and composed by Jonathan Larson, started as a small musical at the NY Theater Workshop and then was transferred to the Nederlander theater where it's still playing. The film has six of the original cast members in it, the exception being Freddie Walker who is substituted by Tracie Thoms and Daphne Rubin-Vega who was the original Mimi, a role that went to Rosario Dawson in the film.This movie will definitely resonate with a younger audience. The music is targeted to them. This is a pop-rock opera and make no mistake about it. Don't go thinking you are going to find anything resembling Puccini's \"La Boheme\". The musical is extremely loosely based on the characters from the opera, but that's where all the comparison ends. The people one sees in the musical are more real because the pain of what is going on in their lives is clearly evident. The AIDS epidemic affects a few of the characters; there are gays and lesbians just being themselves without anyone judging what they do. At the bottom of it all is every day survival in that environment.What \"Rent\" is, it's a celebration of the life on that side of New York during the 80's when anarchists populated the lower east side of Manhattan squatting in abandoned buildings and living precariously at the edge of a society that didn't want them around. The young people that were attracted to the area brought with them a new way of living without prejudice.Alas, everything comes to an end. In fact, just a tour of the area today will show the gentrification that is taking place after Mayor Giuliani and his ilk got these bohemians evicted in order to give way to condominiums and new luxury dwellings where the people the movie celebrate will have no chance to live in them at all. This seems to be the problem when artists create spaces that later on are taken over by the establishment, only to displace the creators, as has happened in Soho, Dumbo, and will not be too far behind in displacing the Williamsburg's artistic settlers.As a film, \"Rent\", has great moments. Even though one has heard the songs many times, there is still a fresh take on them by the talented cast that sing them. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine-Heredia, Jesse Martin, Taye Diggs, Idina Menzel, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson work as an ensemble under the direction of Mr. Columbus, who would have appeared as an unlikely candidate for directing the film, but who brings the best from his talented cast.By the way, \"Rent\" was filmed in the west coast, so don't go looking for any authentic East Village locations, since most of what one sees was probably shot in a studio. The Horseshoe bar is shown on the outside, and a scene of Tompkins Square Park, but the rest is fake.\n\n\n\n\n                67 of 93 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 756 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Did Benny die at the end?\n\n\nQ:\n Which of the characters have HIV/AIDS?\n\n\nQ:\n Is Angel a drag queen, or transgender?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Gaumont Columbia Tristar [France]\n    \n|\n\n            Sony Pictures [United States]\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 19 January 2006 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Najamnina\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nTompkins Square Park - E 10th St, Manhattan, New York City, New York, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$40,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $10,016,021,\n27 November 2005 \n\nGross USA: $29,077,547        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $31,670,620        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Rent Productions LLC, 1492 Pictures, Revolution Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n135 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Curtis Taylor, Jr., a car salesman, breaks into the music business with big dreams. He signs a trio of young women, the Dreamettes, gets them a job backing an R&B performer, James \"Thunder\" Early, establishes his own record label and starts wheeling and dealing. When Early flames out, Curtis makes the Dreamettes into headliners as the Dreams, but not before demoting their hefty big-voiced lead singer, Effie White, and putting the softer-voiced looker, Deena Jones, in front. Soon after, he fires Effie, sends her into a life of proud poverty, and takes Deena and the Dreams to the top. How long can Curtis stay there, and will Effie ever get her due?\nWritten by\n<jhailey@hotmail.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n card game\n|\n jazz\n|\n new york city\n|\n theater\n|\n theater audience\n|\u00a0See All (189)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAll you have to do is dream.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for language, some sexuality and drug content\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    During a break in filming, Beyonc\u00e9 lost weight to make herself look younger for Deena's teen and early years.

I like musical presentation and all; I like theater and the contact of performance. Its all fine, but what really transports me is what I think of as opera in the modern sense. Its that multiple delivery of sense, primarily through sweeping enveloping visual grammar, supplemented by coordinated threads: text, narrative, music, emotional and intellectual.\"Moulin Rouge\" is my gold standard, born as a child of film, deeply reflexive. Chicago was less coherent \u0097 some of its cinematic collage really was just chop, but even then they eye needs rhythm and \"Chicago\" delivered. That film also had something this has only in certain places: sweat if not blood. We knew that Zellweger and Zeta-Jones are uninteresting people, and the songs manufactured emotionally (as opposed to say, blues songs from someone blue). But we saw them work their guts out.This is an odd, odd thing musically. Start with genuine R&B, sung in Detroit basements and school auditoriums. Now transform that for the market, initially black showgoers. Now transform it again for a similar record-buying public. Again for white recordbuyers (where, incidentally I found myself in the late sixties), and then again for TeeVee watchers (and with added glamor, Las Vegas).Let that steep for fifteen years, all becoming a joke, then transform it again for the Broadway stage. By this time, any performance related to this collection of genres cannot be genuine in any way, merely a commentary. The performers may be black, but its as far removed from what it pretends to be as a scene in this film depicts: a white teen along the lines of Johnny Vee covering a black song. Its not a matter of how good the singer is, even the earnest Hudson who gets the applause here. Its a matter of market forces: art is brought to us by market forces and those forces bend, filter, bleach.Now take that stage show, based on a story about just this: how mass music MUST be untrue \u0097 take that stage musical and transform it one more time, and you'll have this. That's six generations from where this music meant something to what it is before it hits our ears. The only thing that can justify this is the full bore experience.The stage show delivered it in spades, because it used extraordinary stagecraft. It was to the stage musical what \"Moulin Rouge\" was to the film musical: the vocabulary stretched to its most colorful (read: moving) excess. Where's that excess here? There are three (three?) moments where a rehearsal sweeps around and you find yourself on stage. Once done well would have been enough, these aren't.One character in this needs to be the white space, the root of the thing in terms of values. Maybe it could have been the avuncular manager (Glover) or the silent Dad, or the child. But no one is given the nail. One song at least needs to be performed as genuine. Yes, Hudson's number brings down the house. But it is so overproduced and overstaged its clear it is merely \u0097 dare I say it? \u0097 a show by a woman trying hard to have a career, not a woman who actually lives in her song.At least \"Hustle and Flow\" was obviously dishonest.Oh well. Seeing Eddie Murphy do James Brown just before the man is buried meant something to me. Its an homage of sorts.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 17 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 535 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why did Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles fail to get an Oscar-nomination for Best Song for \"Listen\" when she was nominated for a Golden Globe for it?\n\n\nQ:\n Why are there so many songs in \"Dreamgirls\" (and other song tidbits)?\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"Dreamgirls\" a biographical film about The Supremes, like \"Ray\" and \"Walk the Line\"?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 22 February 2007 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ne'arot ha'khalomot\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nChatsworth, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$70,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $378,950,\n17 December 2006 \n\nGross USA: $103,365,956        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $155,430,335        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Dreamworks Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Laurence Mark Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n130 min\n|\n140 min\n            (Director's Extended Edition)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n| DTS\n(DTS-X)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They want to dance, they want to sing, to play music, to act but above all they want to live their lives while they are still young and full of energy. Leroy, Danny, Jesse, Chris, Coco and all the others try hard because they know that they've got a long way to go till they reach fame and riches. Fame costs and here (the Art School) is where they start paying for it.\nWritten by\nXenophon Tsakanikas <ftpadmin@antigoni.med.auth.gr> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n student\n|\n performing arts\n|\n new york city\n|\n dance\n|\n high school\n|\u00a0See All (17)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In the final season, Debbie Allen was appearing on Broadway in \"Sweet Charity\". Her stage run overlapped with the filming of the final season. To be able to include her in episodes, the producers filmed all of her scenes in New York City. That is why she appeared only in exterior scenes, and had no interior scenes for several episodes.

The music is for the most part still fresh, and the choreography and dance performances are ageless. The characters as well as the dancing and singing give the show an energy that is contagious and leaves you smiling. Of course the series is not for the literal-minded--what musical is?--so if you are bothered by people \"spontaneously\" bursting into fully-scored singing and fully- choreographed dancing, skip it. If you like music and dance and would enjoy explorations of the dreams and problems of young people by them and the equally-interesting adult faculty of the \"Fame\" school, you'll love this series. It's particularly good viewing for kids, too.\n\n\n\n\n                3 of 3 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 26 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Fischinger was an animator who specialized in the abstract. He was the one who designed the relevant sequence in \"Fantasia\" but never received credit for it. While the film was still produced, he quit the Disney studio in protest. Walt Disney had decided to alter the original designs of the artist to be more representational. When the film was released, the designs had been rendered semi-abstract.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nIn the full-length introduction to the \"Nutcracker Suite\", heard only in the roadshow version of \"Fantasia\", Deems Taylor states that this music is from a longer ballet called \"The Nutcracker\" and \"nobody performs it nowadays\". The full-length \"Nutcracker\" had not been performed in the U.S. yet in 1940, but in both Russia and England it had been staged in 1934, and had already been staged in Russia twice before that, in 1892 and 1919. However, although the \"Nutcracker Suite\" was immensely popular even in 1940, the full-length ballet was still a long way off from becoming the annual phenomenon it now is in the United States.

Uh, my name is Deems Taylor, and it's my very pleasant duty to welcome you here on behalf of Walt Disney, Leopold Stokowski, and all the other artists and musicians whose combined talents went into the creation of this new form of entertainment, \"Fantasia\". What you're going to see are the designs and pictures and stories that music inspired in the minds and imaginations of a group of artists. In other words, these are not going to be the interpretations of trained ...\n\nSee more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    The roadshow cut of the film features no credits or title music, just the Art Deco title card placed at the intermission. The general release cut (the one shown most often) places the title card at the beginning, as on most films.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nThe original \"Pastoral Symphony\" segment featured extremely politically-incorrect \"pickaninny\"-type African American little-girl centaurs who perform servant duties for the female centaurs. These scenes were first edited in the 1969 re-release of the film by physically cutting the offending footage from the film (resulting in an obvious sound jump). For the 1990 and 2000 re-releases, the offending shots were magnified so that Black centaurs do not appear in the frame. The Fantasia Anthology notes the editing of this footage, although the copy of Fantasia that comes with the set is listed as being \"The Original Uncut Version.\" A brief account of this story and at least one actual cel photograph are presented in the book \"Cartoon Confidential\" by Jim Korkis and John Cawley (Malibu Graphics Press).

What we are shown are a few animated musicals, filled with grand splendor and vivid colors. \"Fantasia\" is one of those films that everyone knows by heart, and has watched since being a child. My personal favorite was always the Mickey Mouse short - one of the darkest Mickey cartoons I've ever seen. If you haven't seen \"Fantasia\" yet, then you must be from another planet. It is one of the best Disney musicals ever, which some push aside and forget too easily.  5/5 stars-John Ulmer\n\n\n\n\n                43 of 63 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 354 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How many different versions of Fantasia are there?\n\n\nQ:\n How come many of the pieces do not follow a story?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 19 September 1941 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Fantas\u00eda\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

They realize they are destined to rock, and ultimately form a band that becomes a champion for students sidelined by the high school elite.\nWritten by\nRuby \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n title directed by female\n|\n disney\n|\n disney channel\n|\n disney plus\n|\n 2010s\n|\u00a0See All (20)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Principal Brenigan's comment that he used to be a 'rebel' is a nod to Christopher McDonald's role in Grease 2 (1982) as a T-Bird.

With the recent Disney movies that we have been getting lately, none of them good, Lemonade Mouth stands out being one of the best DCOM, ever. I know that's a big statement but I truly believe it. It was never as successful as say, High School Musical but it was still good and deserved more recognition. This movie came out when I was 10 (I am now 16,) and I still enjoy watching it.A lot of the actors were relatively new in 2011 but everyone did a decent job. I'm not going to lie some of the actors weren't as good as others and there were moments where the acting wasn't the greatest, but it's not like it's trying to win an Oscar or anything. If you watched Disney Channel or Disney XD then you would of noticed familiar faces like Bridget Mendler (Good Luck Charlie, Wizards of Waverly Place) and Adam Hicks (Zeke and Luthor,Pair of Kings.) There were also some new faces like Blake Michael who would later go on to star in the Disney Channel show Dog With a Blog. Naomi Scott was also new back then but has made a bit of a name for herself starring in the 2017 movie Power Rangers. Haley Kiyoko was very good as Stella and you may also recognize her from Wizards of Waverly Place. All of the main actors had great chemistry and you could really see that in the film. They truly made you feel how close they are as a group. I'm not going to lie the music in this movie was actually very good. I didn't expect to enjoy the songs as much as I did.She's So Gone, sung by Naomi Scott, was probably my favourite song in the whole movie her vocals are incredible. The story line is what really makes this movie incredible. I always like a story about the underdogs coming out on top. I love how they had the school treat athletes like they were better because that is how high school is. I liked how each of the characters had there own story line and we got to see each of them develop. The friendship between the five though was what really made this movie great. Unlike this movie they focused mainly on the actual friendship between the five and less on relationships. Sure there was obviously something between Wen and Olivia and Mo and Scott but it never overshadowed the friendship between the band. Overall this movie is a must see and is enjoyable for all ages.\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 14 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 32 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the TV Version and the Extended Version?\n\n\nQ:\n How can I find Disney Channel Auditions?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            DisneyNOW\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 28 April 2011 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Kisela faca\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Martin Chase Productions, GWave Productions, Disney Channel \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n103 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 HD\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When the photo session is over the store is left in a shambles, much to salesgirl Jo Stockton's dismay. Avery stays behind to help her clean up. Later, he examines the photos taken there and sees Jo in the background of one shot. He is intrigued by her unique appearance, as is Maggie Prescott, the editor of a leading fashion magazine. They offer Jo a modeling contract, which she reluctantly accepts only because it includes a trip to Paris. Eventually, her snobbish attitude toward the job softens, and Jo begins to enjoy the work and the company of her handsome photographer.\nWritten by\nalfiehitchie \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n fashion model\n|\n fashion\n|\n fashion designer\n|\n man slaps a woman\n|\n man kisses a woman's hand\n|\u00a0See All (91)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nYou're going to have a marvelous time, on a lavish love-happy Paris holiday, set to the lilting music of the great George Gershwin.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In August 1957, this film was being shown on a double bill with Disney's Johnny Tremain (1957).

The musical numbers are pleasant, if rather on the light side. Stanley Donen has the right touch in keeping things together without making the seams show too often.Hepburn is cast in a somewhat unexpected role, as a drab intellectual store clerk who gets involved with Fred Astaire's (much older) photographer character. Audrey is so charming that's it's very difficult to think of her as a wallflower, and while Astaire is as energetic as ever, there are more than a couple of occasions on which the relationship doesn't really look believable, despite the best efforts of the two stars. The plot isn't supposed to be anything weighty anyway, so perhaps that's the price you have to pay for a rather different pairing.Kay Thompson provides many of the best moments. Sometimes the satire of trendy philosophy comes off well, at other times it gets a little dull. Not to be forgotten are the colorful and interesting settings and backgrounds, which set off the story and music fairly well. It's sometimes a strange combination, but as lighter entertainment it all works well enough.\n\n\n\n\n                38 of 53 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 165 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"Funny Face\" based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n Was \"Funny Face\" actually filmed in Paris?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 25 April 1957 (UK)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Dr\u00f4le de frimousse\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nChamps Elys\u00e9es, Paris 8, Paris, France\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$3,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Paramount Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n103 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(Westrex Recording System)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

K. is a comedy of ideas about a stranger in the city, who asks questions that no one has asked before. They are innocent, child-like questions, but they bring about catastrophic answers. People who are set in their ways for generations, are forced to reappraise their world when they see it from PK's innocent eyes. In the process PK makes loyal friends and powerful foes. Mends broken lives and angers the establishment. P. K.'s childlike curiosity transforms into a spiritual odyssey for him and millions of others. The film is an ambitious and uniquely original exploration of complex philosophies. It is also a simple and humane tale of love, laughter and letting-go. Finally, it is a moving saga about a friendship between strangers from worlds apart.\nWritten by\nAbhijat Joshi \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n religion\n|\n guru\n|\n tv reporter\n|\n alien on earth\n|\n papadum\n|\u00a0See All (126)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Sci-Fi\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Junaid Khan, the son of Aamir Khan, worked as an assistant director in this film.

But after watching PK, I would say that the benchmark should be changed. The same team that brought 3 Idiots has brought another magnificent movie. Everyone in the movie acted exceptionally well. The manner in which the social issues are depicted is very good. If we see the comedy aspects alone, 3 idiots is better. But if we see the social issues taken, PK is far better than the other movie. This is Aamir's best performance till date. Ranbir Kapoor comes in a comical guest role. Anushka Sharma, Sushant Singh Rajput and Saurabh Shukla are the other main characters.Overall rating- 9.5/10\n\n\n\n\n                196 of 307 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 627 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Max Bialystock was once the king of Broadway, but now all his shows close on opening night. Things turn around when he's visited by the neurotic accountant Leo Bloom, who proposes a scheme tailor-made for producers who can only make flops: raise far more money than you need, then make sure the show is despised. No one will be interested in it, so you can pocket the surplus. To this end, they produce a musical called Springtime for Hitler written by escaped Nazi Franz Liebken. Then they get the insanely flamboyant Roger De Bris to direct. Finally, they hire as a lead actress the loopy Swedish bombshell Ulla (whose last name has over 15 syllables). As opening night draws near, what can go wrong? Well, there's no accounting for taste...\nWritten by\nrmlohner \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n scheme\n|\n opening night\n|\n accountant\n|\n swedish\n|\n nazi\n|\u00a0See All (441)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Crime\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for sexual humor and references\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nNathan Lane won the 2001 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, beating out his partner Matthew Broderick. Both re-created their roles in the film. Other cast members that were included in the film from the stage production are Roger Bart, Gary Beach, Brad Oscar, Jim Borstelmann, Madeline Doherty, Bryn Dowling, Kathy Fitzgerald, Robert Fowler, Kimberly Hester, Charley King, Naomi Kakuk, Kevin Ligon, Peter Marinos, Mike McGowan, Jennifer Smith, Jenny Lynn Suckling, Tracy Terstriep, and Courtney Young. Three actors were nominated for the 2001 Tony Award for best featured actor in a musical: Gary Beach who won, Roger Bart, and Brad Oscar. The Producers won the most Tony awards for any show, ever, with 12, and won in every category for which it was nominated. The only nominees from the show who did not win lost to another nominee from the same show.

After Leo takes his heavy, drawling breath and looks back to Max, for one split second, you can see Nathan Lane's mouth turn up in a smile, just about to laugh, and then the camera angle changes. If you watch the Outtakes in the special features, you can see the goof of Lane's in full force; unable to stop himself from laughing, which they simply cut short in the feature.

Then the musical became adapted into a movie. This hilarious spectacle is sure to please! Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick return as Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, the same roles they made famous on Broadway. Lane is a riot, channeling Zero Mostel's bombastic character. Meanwhile, Broderick surprises as he does a decent take on Gene Wilder's original hysterical act. Will Ferrell scores laughs as Nazi playwright Franz Liebkind, and Uma Thurman puts in a good song and dance as Swedish sexpot Ulla. The movie perfectly catches the style of the old-fashioned musical, with a large serving of slapstick. This snappy production is sure to be a hit with everyone!\n\n\n\n\n                72 of 116 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 435 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Are the screenplays for this and the 1968 Producers film exactly the same?\n\n\nQ:\n What did they remove the Lorenzo St. Dubois (LSD) character, played by Dick Shawn in the original film?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 16 March 2006 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Los productores\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\n116th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, New York City, New York, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$45,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $154,590,\n18 December 2005 \n\nGross USA: $19,398,532        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $38,075,318        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Brooksfilms \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n134 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Often ridiculous but never serious, we learn the truth behind the Roman Emperor, we learn what really happened at the Last Supper, the circumstances that surrounded the French Revolution, how to test eunuchs, and what kind of shoes the Spanish Inquisitor wore.\nWritten by\nMurray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n woman coughs\n|\n human chess board\n|\n torture\n|\n year 1789\n|\n roman senate\n|\u00a0See All (146)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nIN MEL WE TRVST                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n History\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nBea Arthur: Uncredited, as a dole office unemployment clerk in \"The Roman Empire\" segment.

It's the perfect example of Mel Brooks comedy.Everyone has their favorite and least favorite part. My favorite was \"The Inquisition\" song.  My least favorite? Probably the French Revolution part, which dragged out for a while.Hey, Mel, do your audience a favor and make \"History of the World: Part II\".  I can just see him harassing Thomas Edison, Jimi Hendrix, Ed Sullivan, Adolph Hitler, and others.\n\n\n\n\n                32 of 49 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 149 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Will there be a part 2?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nLatin\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 12 June 1981 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: La loca historia del mundo\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nCaesars Palace - 3570 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$11,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $4,792,731,\n14 June 1981 \n\nGross USA: $31,672,907        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $31,672,907        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Brooksfilms \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n92 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nStereo\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Timon and Pumbaa are assigned to be her babysitters, but she easily escapes their care and ventures into the forbidden lands. There she meets a lion cub named Kovu and they become friends. What she and her parents do not know is that Kovu is the son of Zira - a banished follower of the now-dead Scar. She plans to raise Kovu to overthrow Simba and become the king of the Pride Lands. This tests not only Kiara and Kovu's relationship as they mature, but Simba's relationship with his daughter.\nWritten by\nRori Stevens \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n timon character\n|\n pumbaa character\n|\n tomboy\n|\n interspecies friendship\n|\n simba character\n|\u00a0See All (124)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe circle of life continues...        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nSuzanne Pleshette and Jason Marsden portray mother and son, Zira and Kovu. Three years following this film, the two actors went on to voice characters with a similar relationship in the Oscar-winning Hayao Miyazaki's animated feature, Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (2001).

And you gotta know who's gonna raise him.\nPumbaa:\nHis parents?\nTimon:\nOkay, sure. Get technical. But who's gonna teach him the real important stuff? Like how to belch.\n[belches]\nTimon:\nAnd dig for grubs. I'm telling you, buddy, it's gonna be like old times.

The music was very good and the art was also most impressive. The only voice I wasn't completely satisfied with was Edward Hibbert as Zazu. Even I could have made a better clone for Rowan Atkinson. The script was somewhat rough, and some of the scenes had some unnecessarily dark undertones, but I still believe this to be the best made sequel yet - thanks largely to some very good songs. Keep it up, Disney!\n\n\n\n\n                35 of 48 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 192 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Does Zira die from falling in the river?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nAustralia\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 27 October 1998 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

So Kermit takes this chance for his big break as he makes the journey to Hollywood. Along the way, Kermit comes across several quirky new friends including comedic Fozzie Bear, beautiful but feisty Miss Piggy, and the Great Gonzo. But Kermit must also watch out for ruthless Doc Hopper, who plans to use him as his spokesman for his frog legs food chain.\nWritten by\nBlazer346 \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n the muppets\n|\n hare krishna\n|\n national film registry\n|\n troubled production\n|\n charlie mccarthy character\n|\u00a0See All (116)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nMore entertaining than humanly possible!        \n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The song \"Never Before, Never Again\" was originally sung by Johnny Mathis, but the producers did not think his rendition was as funny as Frank Oz's version.

The opening scene is a wonderful introduction for this truly excellent film. \nMy favorite of the Muppet movies, this has excellent songs, some truly funny running gags and one-liners (and some that are absolute \"groaners\", but they're still deserving of a chuckle.), and a fun group of Muppets and celebrity cameos.  Jim Henson is, and always will be, the definitive voice of Kermit.  The film itself is very gentle in tone without getting too syrupy, and truly entertains all the way through.With all of the \"quality\" children's programming that comes out these days, I can't help but wonder why more \"family\" films aren't actually made for the entire family like this film was.  This is a real keeper, although it seems a little hard to find at times in the stores.\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 9 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 121 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Today, the zombies pose no threat, but are required to live in Zombietown, an isolated, rundown community infused with their unique creative spirit. When zombies are finally allowed to enroll in Seabrook High School, the charming, charismatic zombie Zed, who is determined to play football, meets freshman Addison, who dreams of being a cheerleader - the ultimate form of status in Seabrook. Addison takes a lot of flak for befriending Zed and his zombie friends, but comes to learn that zombies and cheerleaders aren't so different after all. Zed and Addison work together to show Seabrook what they can achieve when they embrace their differences and celebrate what makes them a community.\nWritten by\nDisney Channel PR \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n zombie\n|\n high school\n|\n cheerleader\n|\n cheer squad\n|\n football player\n|\u00a0See All (24)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAt Seabrook High it's zoms vs. poms.        \n\n\nGenres:\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    All the Zombie Characters in the film have the letter Z in their names.

I thought it was gonna flop. However.....after watching the premiere, I actually really liked it! :DThe characters were really likable, even the \"antagonist/villain\" was likable.There is a lot of \"Diversity\" in this Movie, which was the main message of the Movie from the start.Acceptance & Diversity!Meg Donnelly ie Addison, allows the viewer to see what's like to be accepted amongst your peers only to live with the cripplingly fear of your \"true self\" being exposed, thereby hiding it and showing a \"pretend you\" in order to feel accepted. Which is what a lot of kids/teenagers can relate to when starting a new school with new people.In the end......well I won't spoil it! ;)But just like I mentioned before, acceptance and diversity plays a big role! So this movie is a fun, entertaining movie for children and young teens to watch, and better choreography than Descendants! Oh....and the lip sync is actually better when they sing in this movie! Just putting that out there! :)\n\n\n\n\n                13 of 22 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 93 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

They are still usually put down as much as they were when they were operational.The best \"HAIR\" is beautiful Beverly D'Angelo's, blowing in the wind as she sings \"Good Morning, Starshine\" in the Pontiac convertible with her new friends as they zoom across the Nevada desert to find Claude (John Savage.)Berger (Treat Williams) has two fabulous arguments with \"the authorities,\" both of which are very painful to watch, because you can feel the military-social force over what is considered to be his irresponsibility and paltriness. The first time is at Sheila's wedding party when he resists eviction from the party, and ends up mostly prevailing by dancing on the table--although he and all of his friends end up in jail for it. The second time, at the army base, he does not prevail and the other well-known solution is arrived at. But both times you can feel the quiet violence of authorities against gypsies.Actually, society tells you to be like the Flower Children, then punishes you if you actually do it.Just because a lot of the original Flower Children became Yuppies doesn't mean they didn't do anything important when they were hippies.The 60's were NOT over because of what some otherwise fine writers have \"authoritatively\" said had already begun to occur before the Manson murders. Anything artistically beautiful leaves living traces that endure forever: this film documents one of those movements that mattered.They called this writer \"media poison\" and she wasn't always that. She just called them \"children\" who she more or less said were just \"living this way\" and left it at that. They had been smart not to tell her everything in Haight-Ashbury when she drank gin and took ups to do the story.In the same group of essays, she claims not be interested in \"paradises, real or artificial.\" Well, that explains a lot.She said she was too unstable to take acid when they offered it to her; but this was only partially true: It was fear of paradises.Otherwise, it is impossible to miss how this extraordinary film, made almost 15 years after Haight-Ashbury and the East Village would cease to exist as they had (remaining primarily only as weak mutations reduced to unspeakable New Age ashrams, where the pot was all gone and heavily enforced k.p. duty--vilely called \"karma-yoga things\"--was prevalent) captures so much of the happiness that some of us remember so well still as we continue on as kinds of older hippies...Twyla Tharp's choreography and Ann Roth's colours are all that that strange moment was and is supposed to be--I remember the way people who had used LSD drew stars; you could always tell a psychedelic star, a psychedelic moon, a psychedelic sun. I went to a New York head shop where I was referred to an \"84-year-old morphine addict\" who lived in Paris, who I was to look up as I bought two velvet hats.Some hippies lasted. I saw Adam Purple at the Union Square Market in 1996 riding a bicycle festooned with many balloons and told him how much I had loved his tulip garden in concentric circles grown in a vacant lot in what was then a wino neighborhood on Eldridge Street, about 1977--and then razed for high-rise apartments. He said \"yeah, if it's good it won't last...\"Well, that's not exactly true, of course, but he wouldn't have been a pure hippie artist if he hadn't been able to put it that way, and not try to see it another way.His wife was Eve Purple. I hope he hadn't really married her. They obviously wouldn't have needed to.Beautiful Beverly D'Angelo seems to love Berger and Claude and Hud (Dorsey Wright) and she is never corny about it. Nobody is corny.Corniness has little to do with love.Hud's fiancee is Cheryl Barnes and she sings \"Easy to Be Hard\" full of deep Gospel that resonates dark sounds in Central Park. It is this song that proves the comprehensive intelligence of the show: Hud has just tried to shirk his responsibilities to Cheryl and their young boy. He wants to \"wish them away.\" In this song she talks about how easy it is to be hard, \"especially people who care about strangers...who care about evil and social injustice..\" those same people who will walk away from those close to them when they get in the way of their easy time of it. Gradually, Jeannie and Sheila and Berger and Woof make Hud go back and gather Cheryl and the boy up. Even the hippies were being given a strict test for hypocrisy; the beauty of this is that they pass the test so we can love the hippies. The 'carpool' going across the desert would never have been possible if Cheryl and the baby hadn't been part of the \"mornin' singin' song.\"Central Park has never been more of a movie star than it is in this one, and New York is sure *lookin' good* in this memoir of collective rapture.That same essayist said \"New York was no mere city\" and that she would always have the feeling toward it as of \"the first person who touched you.\"She was often right, of course. It's not my fault she wouldn't give the hippies a break. They had time to help bring on the resistance to the Vietnam War that forever changed the course of what America could then be, no matter how hard it tries to forget it.\"Let the Sunshine In\" makes it impossible for the song in the Pontiac Bonneville convertible to be called \"Good Mornin' Sunshine,\" and that is a true blessing, it goes without saying.It's about those psychedelic stars even though they are under the sun in the morning in Nevada and this moment in the film is like a magic carpet ride all its own. This is where the hippies just get to be hippies (like in THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA when Mrs. Faulk (Ava Gardner) says when Richard Burton finally lets loose \"That's Shannon bein' Shannon!\"):\"Good mornin', Starshine...the earth says 'hello'...you twinkle up above..we twinkle below...\"Good mornin,' Starshine...you lead us along...My love and me as we sing...our early mornin' singin' song...\"Glitty clup cluby...libbee lubbee loobee..oh la la la lo..\"Saba sibbie saba...Dooby aba naba.. lily lo lo..\"Dooby ooby wama...Nooby aba naba.. early mornin' singin' song...\"\"Singin' a song, song to sing...\"Song song song, si-ing sing sing sing-song... \"Song song song, si-ing sing sing sing-song... Song song song, si-ing sing sing sing-song..\"(This is not a cereal song, but it would make cereal seem okay and even macrobiotic food more bearable if one remembers beautiful Beverly D'Angelo and beautiful Treat Williams-it wouldn't even hurt Anita Bryant and Pat Boone and other Baptists, but they couldn't sing it either.)A song about song. Very perfect singin' song, I'd say.\n\n\n\n\n                19 of 38 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 176 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Who is the father of Jeannie's baby?\n\n\nQ:\n Why was Woodrow rejected from the army?\n\n\nQ:\n How is it that an Oklahoman redneck meets up and befriends a group of NYC hippies?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nWest Germany\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 15 March 1979 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Kosa\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nBarstow, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$11,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nGross USA: $15,284,643        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $15,313,606        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n CIP Filmproduktion GmbH \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n121 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\n70 mm 6-Track\n(70 mm prints)| Dolby Stereo\n(35 mm prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Charlie blackmails Miss Price that if he is to keep her practices a secret, she must give him something, so she takes a bedknob from her late father's bed and places the \"famous magic travelling spell\" on it, and only Paul can activate it. Their first journey is to a street in London, where they meet Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), former headmaster of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss Price tells him of a plan to find the magic words for a spell known as \"Substitutiary Locomotion\", which brings inanimate objects to life. This spell will be her work for the war effort.\nWritten by\nMatthew Anscher <anscher@radonc.duke.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n bedknob\n|\n alternate history\n|\n good versus evil\n|\n reference to henri de toulouse lautrec\n|\n lost island\n|\u00a0See All (305)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nYou'll beWITCHED!

All songs are cut, except for \"Portobello Road\", \"Beautiful Briny Sea\" and some parts of \"Substitutiary Locomotion\". Other sequences are reduced (such as Professor Browne's wait at the train station) or cut altogether (such as the disappearance of the magical necklace).

Took me to another world.\n\n                        22 August 2005 | by linnanawoodstock\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nWhat can i say about a tale such as this? This magical tale has followed me from my early childhood,evoking warm memories in my heart.The characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene. For example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore. I loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums.The story line was wonderful.I wanted so badly for Landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with Mr.Brown,and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war.I am still a child inside,and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all times. I hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away,and transported into another time.\n\n\n\n\n                16 of 18 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 115 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n In what year is the movie set?\n\n\nQ:\n What is \"bubble-and-squeak\"?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGerman\n\n\nRelease Date: 13 December 1971 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Hokus pokus kosteskaft\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nDorset, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$20,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n117 min\n|\n139 min\n            (1996)\n            (restored)\n          |\n99 min\n            (re-release)\n            (1980)\n          |\n130 min\n            (initial US release)\n            (November 1971)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\n3 Channel Stereo\n(RCA Sound Recording)\u00a0(5.0)\u00a0(L-R)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.66 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

However we don't need a Disney level song EVERY five minutes... it's great once in a while but 4 in a 30 minute episode drags the show out without really developing the story necessarily. Sometimes the songs just seem arbitrary and unnecessary. Otherwise I love the show. Great talent, great premise, just lagging in story development because I have to sit through long musical numbers about small things.\n\n\n\n\n                12 of 22 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 105 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

So he takes the next dancer he meets, Hannah Brown, as a new partner. After a while, this new team is so successful that Florenz Ziegfeld is interested in them, but due to the fact that Nadine Hale also dances (and stars) in the Ziegfeld Follies, Don says no. Despite the fact that he is in love with Hannah, he keeps the relation with her strictly business. So Hannah is of the opinion that he is still in love with Nadine, and her suspicion grows when he dances with Nadine in a Night Club Floor Show.\nWritten by\nStephan Eichenberg <eichenbe@fak-cbg.tu-muenchen.de> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n camp\n|\n dance\n|\n dancing\n|\n easter\n|\n performer\n|\u00a0See All (70)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Happiest Musical Ever Made is Irving Berlin's Easter Parade                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nAnn Miller had to perform her biggest numbers in a back brace. In an interview with Robert Osborne, she revealed that she had been thrown down the stairs by her then husband Reese Milner. She was also pregnant at the time and was in a lot of pain.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nMost (or all) of the musical arrangements, costumes, and hairstyles date from a much later time period than the setting of the film (1911-1912). This is especially notable as many scenes are stage performances. Although a haphazard attempt is made to make the women's street clothing and hats appear to approximate the 1912 time frame, from the knees down, the light-colored stockings and shoe styles are strictly 1948.

I imagine it looks spectacular, because even the VHS looked super. I'm talking about the Technicolor. Man, those Technicolor films in the '40s were beautiful, as this certainly is.For entertainment, you get Fred Astaire dancing, Judy Garland singing, Ann Miller dancing, and Peter Lawford singing. I didn't think Lawford could sing, but he's not bad here. The other talent must have elevated his. Astaire consistently amazed audiences with his innovative dance routines and smooth style. He does a number here in a toy store that is really something! Miller also gives us a good tap number and Garland's songs are all winners.This movie is more vehicle for those above-mentioned stars than it is in telling some profound the story. The story is not much, but who cares? It's the dancing, singing, the incredible costumes, overall color, nice people and just plain feel-good musical atmosphere that makes this a popular film, even to this day.\n\n\n\n\n                33 of 37 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 90 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Chapter Headings, an unofficial version:\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n|\nItalian\n\n\nRelease Date: 8 July 1948 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Intermezzo l\u00edrico\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios - 10202 W.

With only a week left before shooting begins, he desperately searches for answers and inspiration from his wife, his mistress, his muse, and his mother. As his chaotic profession steadily destroys his personal life, Guido must find a balance between creating art and succumbing to its obsessive demands.\nWritten by\nThe Massie Twins \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n based on stage musical based on film\n|\n love triangle\n|\n cheating wife\n|\n cheating husband\n|\n implied nudity\n|\u00a0See All (225)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThis Holiday Season, Be Italian        \n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for sexual content and smoking\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nMarion Cotillard's character Luisa, is half-French and half-Italian. In 8\u00bd (1963), the character was played by French actress Anouk Aim\u00e9e. Aim\u00e9e is the first actress to be nominated for an Oscar for a French-speaking role (Un homme et une femme (1966)), while Cotillard is the first and only actress to win an Oscar for a French-speaking role (La Vie En Rose (2007)).

Nothing. \"Maestro, should this be red?\" Yes. \"Green?\" No. \"More extras?\" Yes. \"More lipstick?\" No. Yes. No. Yes. No. That's directing.\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nConnections\n        Featured in WatchMojo: Top 10 Worst Movies with Great Casts\u00a0(2015)\n\n\n        See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nSoundtracks\nKyrie \nWritten by Gabriel Faur\u00e9 \nPerformed by The American Boychoir \nCourtesy of Albermarle Records \nBy arrangement with The Orchard  See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Reviews\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnother excellent adaptation from Rob Marshall\n\n                        23 November 2009 | by doubleosix\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nThe film is beautiful, visually stunning, and exciting, and the cast is remarkable, especially Penelope Cruz (no surprise there), Marion Cotillard (her singing is wonderful), and the gal who blows the doors off -- an unrecognizable (to me, anyhow) Fergie! I was watching the credits to see who the hell played Saraghina, and was stunned to learn it was Stacy Ferguson. Go Fergie! Judi Dench is a smash as well. Nicole Kidman doesn't reveal anything we haven't seen before, but she does bring the large dollop of Movie Star shine for which her role calls. Even Kate Hudson pleases; her 60's go-go dance will inevitably bring comparisons to her mother's \"Laugh In\" heyday.Having said all that, I honestly don't know who is the audience for this film. \"Nine\" was hardly the Broadway smash that \"Dreamgirls\", or \"Chicago\" was, and the score is entirely obscure. Additionally, do most people really care about the trials and tribulations of a self-involved, duplicitous 1960's-era Italian filmmaker? Does it matter? Do you have to actually like the protagonist to learn something from his experiences? Box-office-wise, this picture is going to live or die on the reviews, and people's interest in seeing these actresses shine. (I read here that Renee Zellwegger was under consideration for a role in this film... What a disaster that would have been!) And, of course, those who like seeing Daniel Day Lewis stretch new muscles (he chain smokes! He sings!) I enjoyed it very, very much... and now I'm very curious to see what the world thinks of it.\n\n\n\n\n                127 of 235 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 254 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is \"Nine\" based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n Who has played Guido Contini on stage?\n\n\nQ:\n Why is it called \"Nine\"?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\n            Official site [France]\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUK\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nItalian\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 7 January 2010 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Devet\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nItaly\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$80,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $257,232,\n20 December 2009 \n\nGross USA: $19,676,965        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $54,004,950        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n The Weinstein Company, Relativity Media, Marc Platt Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n118 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| DTS\n| Dolby SR\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n|  Black and White\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Stylistically, it lies somewhere between LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) and the adult-oriented films of Ralph Bakshi (without the sex and violence, naturally); as such, it stands oddly alongside the studio's usual fare from this rather lame era - and its vitality can now be seen to have foreshadowed the renaissance in quality (and critical appraisal) which they witnessed soon after, beginning with THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989). The anthropomorphic characters (which generally swamp the humans - Fagin is very much a good guy here, if still pitiful) are quite nicely fitted to class stereotypes: hence, we get a Hispanic chihauha (with an eye for the ladies) and a posh bulldog, among others, while Dodger is basically an updated version of Tramp and Oliver himself a cute but very brave kitten. The familiar and involved plot is all but jettisoned (especially in its second half) in favor of boisterous action and character comedy, with a bouncy score and rapid pace to match. In the end, it proved surprisingly good - and, at just 74 minutes, short enough not to overstay its welcome.\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 16 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 112 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

While Rahul has been adopted, Yashvardhan and Nandini treat him as their own. When their sons mature, they start to look for suitable brides for Rahul, and decide to get him married to a young woman named Naina. When Rahul is told about this, he tells them that he loves another woman by the name of Anjali Sharma. Yashvardhan decides to meet with the Sharma family, and finds out that they are middle-classed, unsophisticated, and will not be able to it into his family circle, as a result he refuses to permit Rahul to marry Anjali. A defiant Rahul decides to leave, gets married to Anjali, without his foster parents blessings, and re-locates to London, England, where Anjali's unmarried sister, Pooja, also lives. Rohan, who was studying in a hostel, returns home to find that Rahul is no longer living with them, and he also discovers that while outwardly his dad is not interested...\nWritten by\nrAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com) \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n love\n|\n melodrama\n|\n marriage\n|\n funeral\n|\n wealth\n|\u00a0See All (50)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAny weak man can say he's sorry.

The shrewd publicity campaign ensured that wherever Hindi films are shown, a fever pitch of anticipation sharpened to incandescent proportions over the preceding several months.  A record 650 prints of the film have gone into distribution-unprecedented for a Bollywood release.  The cast of the film is equally unparalleled: Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Hrithik Roshan, Kareena Kapoor, plus another popular leading lady in a `guest' appearance, form the headliners.  Such a formidable phalanx of stars alone would guarantee that this film would elbow out the competition.  So, you ask, how good is this film; was the foregoing hoop-la justified?Let's put it like this: I saw it this afternoon (first day, first show, just like in my student days!) and, though it is a shrewd and manipulative exercise in filmmaking, I bought into it.  I laughed, I cried, I resisted the urge to dance in the aisles.  The word `shrewd' comes to mind again and again.  The casting was shrewd, the marketing blitz, as well.  Ditto, for the mix of the film's ingredients, the plotline, and clever typecasting. Shrewd, shrewd, shrewd!  But Karan Johar persuades you to overlook the blatant exploitation of your emotions, the plot twists seen coming a mile away, the unsubtle set-up of the next dramatic confrontation.  He inveigles you into colluding with him in this charming filmic flim-flam; he winks broadly and you roll your eyes but go along for the ride.  Why?  Because the characters, while not the least bit new, are likable.  Johar handles his dauntingly large cast well, gives each of them a moment to shine.\nAmitabh reprises his stern unyielding patriarch role.  He has portrayed uptightness before, as recently as `Mohabbatein', but here he's filthy rich and the stakes have been ratcheted up a notch.  He plays a captain of industry, though what industry, we are never told.  References are made to his appearances on CNN, so one gathers he is a globally important captain of industry. As is the wont of tycoons, he lives in an enormous salmon pink palace, but inexplicably, all the indoor scenes take place only in the cavernous drawing room with its spooky shadows and fifty-foot ceilings (like the lobby of a particularly unwelcoming hotel), or in his dressing room. Early in the film, his business tycoon character is shuttled to the office in a helicopter.  The man gets out, shoots a look of proprietary pride at the monogrammed chopper and deadpans to a minion, `Nice machine!  Should get a few more!'Jaya plays his worshipful, obedient wife clad in matronly pastel sarees with tasteful embroidery and triple strand of pearls--appropriate Mrs. Tycoon garb.  Just as you question the wisdom of coaxing her out of retirement for this thankless role, Johar gives her a small scene where she puts her steely-eyed pig-headed husband in his place, and this without raising her voice and thundering as he does, and you think, right on! Then it makes sense that she is in the film.  Shah Rukh, as their son, plays Shah Rukh yet again, alternatingly lovelorn and stubborn, but here he gets to do some comedic shtick too.  Mercifully, it's not slapstick; in fact, all the humor in the film is intelligent.  Even Johnny Lever, who is insufferable in most films, is given some pretty good lines.  But best are the throwaway ones that Shah Rukh, and on a couple of occasions, Kajol, toss off casually. Anyway, Shah Rukh has a London MBA in this film, and good thing too, because he has to go off and make his own fortune in the tough, cruel world. Oops! I gave away something you'd never have guessed would happen in a Hindi film.It is a delight to see Kajol in a film that makes good use of her looks and skills.  Her screen appearances are becoming rare and it is a shame to see her squandered in execrable fare like `Raju Chacha'.  In `K3G', she looks ravishing, is photographed lovingly, and positively sparkles playing, once again, a character called Anjali.  Hindi filmgoers will recall that Anjali was her character's name in Johar's debut film, `Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'. This Anjali is from Delhi's Chandni Chowk and speaks an outlandish mix of Hindi and Punjabi.  You don't understand it all, but her sheer effervescence bowls you over, so it's no surprise that Shah Rukh (whose character, like the one he played in `Kuch Kuch Hota Hai', is named Rahul) falls for her almost immediately.  They go into an extended dream sequence that involves them singing around the Pyramids, a heretofore-unused location in Hindi films. Kajol wears loads of kohl and numerous stunning monochromatic sarees which contrast well with the starkness of the Egyptian sands, while Shah Rukh, not to be outdone, resorts to see-through organdy shirts. Unfortunately, right after the sartorial one-upmanship of this song, daddy announces he has other plans for his son, and thus begins the `Gham' (sorrow, tears) portion of the film.Hrithik and Kareena play the other romantic leads and they are adorable. I got a kick out of the back story that Hrithik's character has been given: in early childhood, he was obese and all the scenes featuring the boy Hrithik (played by an extremely tubby child actor), show him either eating or conniving to get something to eat.  So all you overweight boys out there, take heart-you could well grow up, turn into a Hrithik, captain a winning cricket team, and end up with a cutie-patootie like Kareena Kapoor!  But I should caution that it is unlikely that this would happen outside the wacky world of Hindi films. The grown up Hrithik is endearingly earnest and sets about restoring the `khushi' (joy, happiness) of his film family, but takes time out to drive fast cars, and show off some nifty dance moves and bicep revealing leather vests. But mostly, as he performs good works, he gazes soulfully, while his brown eyes glisten with unshed tears.Kareena Kapoor's character is modeled after Archana Puran Singh's in `Kuch Kuch Hota Hai', so of course I loved her.  After seeing Ms. Puran Singh in a film called `Raja Hindustani', I became a big fan of her work.  In that movie, she played a deliciously evil stepmother, had a fabulous wardrobe and was nasty to everyone within hollering distance.  She was so enthusiastically wicked that she completely overshadowed the insipid heroine played by Kareena's older sister Karisma Kapoor.  But, enough about that film.  Here Kareena, channeling the spirit of Ms. Puran Singh, vamps hilariously and is adorably clueless.  She is aided and abetted by two sweetly dim cohorts.  Of course, like any self-respecting younger female lead, her clothes are skimpy to the point of being almost non-existent. One of the best lines in the film has to do with her blink-and-you'll-miss-it outfits.  That she pulls this off without looking cheap or vulgar is to her credit.  After this and her similarly fabric-challenged turn in the awful `Asoka', the courageous Ms. Kapoor should be given some sort of award for conserving cloth and her contribution towards reducing the wardrobe budgets of films.So you see, I had a couple of good laughs, tapped my feet to the songs (the handiwork of three different composers), and shed several cathartic tears that Karan Johar contrived to wring out of me. Of course, the \"gham\" (sorrow, tears) in the film was disproportionate to the amount of \"khushi\"(happiness), but as a friend e-mailed me, what good is a Hindi film without the opportunity to weep copiously!  I walked out thinking, `There was nothing new, I was hoodwinked with my complete cooperation, and it was all good fun!'\n\n\n\n\n                12 of 23 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 138 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

What unfolds is an adventure which follows a doubting boy, who takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole; during this ride, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery which shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe.\nWritten by\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n santa claus character\n|\n christmas movie\n|\n male protagonist\n|\n based on children's book\n|\n train engineer\n|\u00a0See All (131)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nTake the journey in IMAX 3D                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In the beginning of the movie, Hero Boy looks at a picture of himself on a store Santa's lap. The store is Herpolsheimer's, an old department store in Grand Rapids,Michigan, Chris Van Allsburg's hometown. Later, the train passes by the store.

However the Conductor steps off the train but leaves no footprints in the snow.

I was listening for a sound I was afraid I'd never hear: the sound of Santa's sleigh bells.\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    The production company credits are covered with snow and ice.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nOn some ABC Family/Freeform airings, the first hobo scene was cut entirely. That results in Hero Boy finding the light from beyond that abruptly disappears for his reaction. The scene where the Conductor explains the first gift of Christmas was cut as well, skipping to the scene where the elves appear.

I could not only hear the bells, I could see his sleigh in the night sky. Chris Van Allsburg is to be commended for writing an excellent fantasy and Tom Hanks for conducting the wonder tour to beat them all. The special effects are just outstanding, the story line credible and heartwarming. The characters are believable and utterly charming. The children depicted are our own. I would recommend this film to any and all who love Christmas and remember what it is to believe. The experience of watching makes you a participant, breathless to see what comes next. I can hardly wait to view it on IMAX and am taking my entire family, including seven grandchildren to the Tulsa Cinemark this season. Let's hope we see more of this quality venue in months and years to come.\n\n\n\n\n                103 of 156 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 570 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why are there two actors for each of the major children's parts?\n\n\nQ:\n What is the instrument the Hobo is playing on the roof of the train?\n\n\nQ:\n What is \"The Polar Express\" about?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            The Polar Express Wikia\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 9 December 2004 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: El expreso polar\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nArctic Ocean\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$165,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $23,323,463,\n14 November 2004 \n\nGross USA: $187,935,490        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $314,215,454        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Castle Rock Entertainment, Shangri-La Entertainment, Playtone \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n100 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n| IMAX 6-Track\n| 12-Track Digital Sound\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Too often mis-labeled a musical, this film is a \"rock opera.\" There are no spoken lines, everything is sung.\nWritten by\nRalf Southard <rps8@psu.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n babe\n|\n rock opera\n|\n palestinian\n|\n palestine\n|\n mary magdalene character\n|\u00a0See All (42)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nand now the film...                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n History\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Rober Ebert gave this movie ***, and said it was an improvement on the Broadway show which he called \"turgid\".

Unfortunately, while I was acquainted with many of the songs before, I had never really seen it in its entirety before, and I'm not sure why.  Also, I've never seen it as a live stage show, be it on Broadway, in London or down the street at the local high school ...So, then, I can only rate it as a singular movie experience, not comparing it with the Broadway or London stagings.  Also, being Jewish and never really studying the life and crucifixion of Jesus, I don't have any strong or pre-conceived spiritual ties to the story.For me, then, this is a cleverly written and very well-performed musical, that mixes irreverence, time juxtapositions and genuine emotions of sadness and wistfulness.  I'm not sure that the movie enhances the great musical; in other words, now that I've seen the movie, I regularly listen to the cd of the musical, and enjoy both about equally.  For me, Carl Anderson, as Judas, is the standout, but Ted Neeley does bring an angelic quality to the title character.  all of the other supporting roles, including Yvonne Elliman, are done well.I rate it 8/10 for its excellent music, good staging and for what seems like a faithful film-ization of the original..worth watching for sure!\n\n\n\n\n                32 of 40 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 228 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Was Ian Gillan who portrait the character of JC on stage was ever considered for the screen?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 15 August 1973 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Jesucristo Superstar\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nAvdat, Israel\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $115,531        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Universal Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n106 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\n70 mm 6-Track\n(Westrex Recording System)\u00a0(70 mm prints)| Mono\n(35 mm optical prints)| 4-Track Stereo\n(35 mm magnetic prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

And I'm not even sure how, because we didn't have a TV then. It must have been a combination of marketing at Walmart and other retailers with episodes (including episodes in Spanish) available on YouTube, and then eventually iTunes purchases. Since then it has been an off-and-on favorite of both kids (mostly in Spanish translation) through 2019. It's not bad, but a little too much of a massive Disney advertisement for my taste: the underlying message that any girl, even \"commoners,\" can become a princess by learning, and the regular cameos by \"real\" Disney princesses such as Ariel, is thinly veiled marketing. But at least Sofia's step-sister Amber is in line for the crown, and Sofia's kind-hearted actions are promoted, instead of Amber's usually bratty behavior.\n\n\n\n\n                1 of 1 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 20 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Songwriters Alan Menken and Glenn Slater saw an opportunity to repurpose the song for this next chapter in Rapunzel's life, and retooled it to be the title sequence number for the series.

Of course, the couple seem to act a great deal like the characters they play. A fight on the opening night threatens the production, as well as two thugs who have the mistaken idea that Fred owes their boss money and insist on staying next to him all night.\nWritten by\nJohn Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n 3 dimensional\n|\n 3d\n|\n spanking\n|\n man spanks woman\n|\n husband spanks wife\n|\u00a0See All (91)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nMGM presents Hollywood's first important BIG MUSICAL in 3-D on our Panoramic Screen with MIRACLOUS STEREOPHONIC SOUND!

Miss Durbin already had rejected the chance to portray Lili in London's West End, where the British production played 400 performances at the Coliseum Theatre, running from March 8, 1951 until February 23, 1952. Patricia Morison, Broadway's original Lilli, re-created the part in London.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nWhen Bianca is by the fountain, she is carrying a net which she tosses away. It lands to the right of the fountain. A few shots later the net is missing; a few shots after that, it has returned.

The distributors would make a fortune!Everyone knows the plot of Kiss Me, Kate, so there's no sense in going into that.  Kathryn Grayson, Hollywood's finest singer of all time replaced Patricia Morrison who played Lilli on Broadway, and Howard Keel replaced Alfred Drake who played Fred Graham on Broadway, and Ann Miller replaced Lisa Kirk who played Lois on Broadway, and it's not too well known but Lisa Kirk dubbed Everything's Coming Up Roses for Rosalind Russell in the movie version of Gypsy!Tommy Rall who replaced Harold Lang in the Broadway version, to me, was never given a fair chance in Hollywood.  An excellent singer and versatile dancer, but still he shines in his work in Kiss Me, Kate and for his work in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers as the brother Frank who got upset when he was called by his real name.This movie is a good example as to why Broadway stars are not necessarily good for repeating their Broadway roles on the screen.  The cast in this movie is excellent in their acting, singing and dancing and I can not picture the Broadway cast repeating their roles in the movie version.  To me, it just wouldn't work!Casting Ann Miller in the role of Lois Lane was a good break for Ann Miller since she was always given roles in past movies that showed her off as a gal who had an overly-obnoxious appetite for the opposite sex.  This film gave her a chance to display her full range of talent which had in the past been overlooked, but what can a person say about her number Too Darn Hot that burned up the screen and made Lilli [Kathryn Grayson] furious with her co-star Fred-er-rick Gray-ham [Howard Keel] to the point that she called him a louse of stage in front of the cast in the play!  She couldn't call him what Patricia Morrison called Alfred Drake in the Broadway play because in those days the Hayes Office wouldn't allow Kathryn Grayson to call Howard Keel a ba****d!Keenyn Wynn and James Whitmore played the comical gangsters that were to collect a marker from Howard Keel which was really signed by Tommy Rall and when they do their number Brush Up Your Shakespeare, it's hilarious.  Not because Wynn can't sing and dance, he can, but because James Whitmore gave it all he could, but faked the number beautifully, and Whitmore had the good sense never to perform in a musical ever again, but together they were excellent in their comedic performance as the gangsters in the film.So, you guys who distribute this movie - give us guys and gals a break and release this in the original wide-screen 3-D version with stereophonic sound and let everyone see why:KISS ME KATE - IS \"STILL\" GREAT!\n\n\n\n\n                42 of 48 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 82 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

She lives a sheltered life and is shy and unfulfilled. When she gets caught in a snowstorm while chasing her dog Toto, they're transported to the mysterious Land of Oz, where she's informed that the only way she can find her way home is through the assistance of the powerful wizard in the Emerald City. As she searches for him by easing down the Yellow Brick Road, she befriends some creatures who face problems in their lives. In their quest to find the wizard, they also face Evillene, the equally evil sister of Evermean, the wicked witch whom Dorothy inadvertently killed when she arrived in Oz; Evillene might be their biggest obstacle.\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n wizard\n|\n new york city\n|\n thanksgiving\n|\n dog\n|\n witch\n|\u00a0See All (64)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Motown remake of \"The Wizard of Oz\"!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Original director John Badham was fired when he objected to 33-year-old Diana Ross being cast as 14-year-old Dorothy.

Several scenes cut included:\nThe arrival of the baby and its family at Aunt Emme's party.\nSome of the dancing and the Poms sequence with the Munchkins (it cut from them going down the stairs to some of them doing acrobatics).\nPortions of Mean Ole Lion were cut out.\nThe chase sequence in the subway platform omitted how the Scarecrow and the Tin Man are rescued by the Lion.\nThe Poppy Girls close-up shot was cut.\nDance portions in the Emerald city during the Green and Red clothing were cut.\nThe entire Emerald City Motel sequence was omitted plus Dorothy asking the guards of the gate how to get to Evilynn's.

That's not to say it's a neglected masterpiece. Not by a long shot. Directed by the estimable Sidney Lumet (\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\", \"Network\", last year's \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\"), the epic-length film is a regrettable misfire on several counts with its chief liability being a rickety story structure due to an early-career foible of a screenplay by current schlock-master Joel Schumacher (\"Batman Forever\", \"The Phantom of the Opera\"). The 1975 Broadway musical version was a zesty, all-black update of Frank Baum's original story that became a long-running hit. Schumacher eschewed the book of the stage version in order to customize the role of Dorothy, written as a pre-pubescent Kansas farm girl, for a then 34-year old Diana Ross, still riding high off \"Lady Sings the Blues\" and \"Mahogany\". Consequently, in the film version, Dorothy has inexplicably become a 24-year old Harlem schoolteacher with a severe case of social anxiety disorder.Because the original 1939 film version of \"The Wizard of Oz\" is so familiar, there is virtually no sense of surprise in the way of plot. The challenge becomes watching a dowdy, skeletal-looking Ross react to her surreal surroundings in such an excessively na\u00efve manner as to make Dorothy appear in need of a special education program. That leaves her three road companions to pick up the slack, and for the most part, they do. One can now feel melancholic over Michael Jackson's youthfully energetic turn as the Scarecrow since it is the only time his abundant talents have been captured on the big screen. He does his trademark spins and jumps in an exuberant duet with Ross on the show's most famous number, \"Ease on Down the Road\", probably the film's best moment. Comedian Nipsey Russell makes a likeably philosophical Tin Man, but it's Ted Ross who truly shines as Fleetwood the Lion in a performance that compares favorably to Bert Lahr's cowardly original. A rather hyper Richard Pryor makes a barely-there appearance in the title role. The women fare even less well. Theresa Merritt has just a few scenes upfront as kindly Aunt Emma, Mabel King does her blustery best to make an impression as Evillene the Wicked Witch in just a couple of scenes, and the legendary Lena Horne is simply wasted as Glinda the Good in static repose as she belts out her one number, \"If You Believe in Yourself\".The film picks up considerable energy during the production number set to Luther Vandross' \"Everybody Rejoice/Brand New Day\", but Lumet just doesn't know when to stop it. Like Martin Scorsese (1977's \"New York, New York\") and John Huston (1982's \"Annie\"), Lumet is a director out of his depth within the necessary fleetness of the musical genre, and the film's pacing lags over its excessive running time of 133 minutes. The one element that remains impressive over the years is Tony Walton's creative costumes and elaborate production design turning New York City into a surreal series of carnival rides. Most ironically, the World Trade Center is made over into Emerald City and the Twin Towers plaza becomes the setting for an Earth, Wind & Fire-style disco ensemble. For what is marketed as a special edition package, the 2008 DVD is surprisingly bereft of meaningful extras \u0096 a brief making-of featurette made at the time of production, the original theatrical trailer and a CD with eight of the movie's songs. The movie is a misbegotten mess with just a few forgotten jewels.\n\n\n\n\n                40 of 62 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 167 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

One by one, a whole group of dwarves drop in, and before he knows it, Bilbo has joined their quest to reclaim their kingdom, taken from them by an evil dragon named Smaug. The only problem is that Gandalf has told the dwarves that Bilbo is an expert burglar, but he isn't....\nWritten by\nMurray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n treasure\n|\n butterfly\n|\n chorus\n|\n cheer\n|\n baritone\n|\u00a0See All (109)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nBased on the original version of the Hobbit.        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Many characters in The Hobbit are related to characters in The Lord of the Rings. Bilbo is of course Frodo's uncle. He is also a Took on his mother's side, making him a cousin to Peregrin Took (Pippin). Elrond is actually a great-uncle to Aragorn (several generations removed). Gloin is the father of Gimli, while the Elven King (named Thranduil) is the father of Legolas. Surprisingly, Gimli and Legolas do not appear in Rankin/Bass's subsequent film, 'The Return of the King (1981)(TV)'.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nWhen Bilbo finds the ring it's shown with an elaborate design on it. In the book the ring was plain and unadorned. Although when you put it in the fire, writing in the Black Speech appears.

See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nThe 2001 DVD release by Warner Brothers omited a number of sound effects from the origianl Sony VHS release.  The sound when characters die; when Sting attacks the Spiders in Mirkwood; Smaug's screams as he attacks Lake Town; the flapping of the Thrush's wings in all scenes; when the arrows bounce off of Smaug and when the Black Arrow pierces Smaug's belly; and the howling of the Wargs during the Battle of Five Armies.

This movie was made for TV, so it had a lower budget than it would have in Hollywood, 2. It was made in 1977, so it has a lower quality animation than we are now used to now, and 3. It is a children's movie, they had to make it child friendly.I remember spending a whole summer of my childhood watching this movie over and over again, nearly wearing out the tape. I have since read the book and still love and own the movie. In fact, to this day every time the subject of LOTR comes up I start humming \"the greatest adventure...\".\n\n\n\n\n                58 of 61 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 144 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What was Durin's Day?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nJapan\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 27 November 1977 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: El Hobbit\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nTopcraft studios, Tokyo, Japan\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$3,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n ABC Video Enterprises, Rankin/Bass Productions, Topcraft \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n77 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Elena's adventures will lead her to understand that her new role requires thoughtfulness, resilience and compassion, the traits of all truly great leaders. Since she is only 16 years old, she has a Grand Council comprised of her grandparents, older cousin Chancellor Esteban and a new friend, Naomi, to give advice along the way.

It has the same animation style as STF and it's also a musical, but I found myself really enjoying it. It has a good message and it's interesting enough. The characters are likable and the songs they sing are actually really good. I like the idea of a Latina princess too, it's really nice. The only request I have is that they should try to make the show appeal more to 9-14 year olds, which I'm guessing is the primary age group of people who even watch Disney Channel. Right now, from what I've seen, it's more of Disney Junior material. That doesn't mean it's a bad show, though. If they succeed in making it more relateable and geared towards the 9-14 age group, I would probably like it way more then I already do. Anyway, it's a good show and I'm glad that Disney Channel is bringing back animated shows.\n\n\n\n\n                13 of 19 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 16 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is not their best show, plus it is not even close to the classic Silly Synphonies, but it is light years from their worst. Sure it can have its predictable moments, but it is better than it's made out to be. I often see it criticised for being a rip-off of Dora the Explorer. True, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse uses the talk-to-the-camera technique, but so do other shows even before Dora. And I may get some flack for this opinion, but I think this is better than Dora. Dora I find annoying and repetitive, and other than counting to one to ten in Spanish I learnt little from it.Back to Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The stories can be predictable and the dialogue overly-simplistic. Plus the pacing of the episodes can be rushed or draggy. However, I liked the animation. It has been criticised for being rough, robotic and lacking variety. Maybe so at first, but I for one think it improved. The backgrounds are colourful and bright, the colours are nice and the character designs are fairly good. The clubhouse actually looks very interesting in my view. The music is pretty decent too. The theme song is simple but memorable, and the accompanying music is decent enough. I personally thoroughly enjoy the Hot Dog Dance, and liked its imaginative and funny name.I also liked the social and creative skills that Mickey Mouse Clubhouse teaches children. Children I think will be delighted by the fun that goes into this show(I have toddler friends who adore this show), adults mayn't be so impressed, but the look on their child's faces will say it all as they learn new skills in every episode. The characters are engaging enough for the target audience. Mickey, despite the criticism he smiles too much contrary to his more mischievous persona in the original cartoons, is very benevolent and an ideal character for children to at least relate to. Goofy is still funny, and Minnie and Daisy are interesting without being too vapid. My only disappointment character-wise is Donald, I don't hate him far from it, but I would have liked to seen more of his cantankerous personality that made him so funny yet endearing in the originals. Morever, the voice acting from the late Wayne Allwine, Bill Farmer, Tony Alselmo, Russi Taylor and Tress MacNeille is rock solid.To conclude, it is a good show but no classic. 7/10 Bethany Cox\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 14 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 47 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Instead, it is celebrated in the town of Bu\u00f1ol, in Spain, and it is called La Tomatina.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nThe scene after the tomato festival where Taylor and Raf go wash at the beach probably wouldn't show the sun setting on the sea. It's debatable, since the closest shoreline to their location in Apulia is 20 miles north-west, where the sun would always rise over the sea. Though if they traveled 80 miles south-west to the Gulf of Taranto they would be facing the other direction. Since the tomato festival isn't given an exact location is hard to say.

This is the ridiculous premise of this feel-good musical film which is also a blatant Mamma Mia rip off. The wedding, the songs, the locations, it is impossible not to see the link between the two movies.Flawed as Mamma Mia was, at least it could rely on heavyweight actors like Meryl Streep, Colin Firth and Pierce Brosnan. The cast of this movie is nowhere near as good , and what the movie lacks in the embarrassingly simple plot, it fails to make up with chemistry and charm.This paper-thin feel-good movie no doubt hopes to cash in on its many similarities with worldwide hit movie Mamma Mia, and both movies basically works as advertisements for holidays in Italy, showcasing breathtakingly beautiful settings.All in all, the movie is not without its little charms and the 80s soundtrack surely appeals to many, so for an evening of feel-good fun this might just work for you, just don't expect any form of depth, thoughtfulness, cultural weight or lasting memories. I'm pretty sure you will have forgotten all about this movie in a couple of months.\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 17 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 47 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

They successfully escape to Passamaquoddy, Maine and live with lighthouse-keeper Nora and her father Lampie, but the corrupt Dr. Terminus seeks Elliott for medical purposes.\nWritten by\nMatthew Anscher <ansch002@acpub.duke.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n live action animated hybrid\n|\n combined animation and live action\n|\n psychotronic film\n|\n 2d animation\n|\n traditional animation\n|\u00a0See All (53)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nBrazzle Dazzle Brilliance!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Disney considered Olivia Newton-John to play Nora, but she was not available. Helen Reddy took the role because it was the best script she had been offered after her role as a singing nun in \"Airport 1975 (1974)\" and because she felt it would be the most appropriate for her as-yet unborn grandchildren to watch. After this film she mostly gave up acting.

It originally ran 134 minutes. After its premiere engagement in Hollywood, it was cut down to 121 minutes before it premiered in New York. When it was released in Europe, it ran 105 minutes, with the following edits:  -\"Candle on the Water\" (which survived only as an instrumental passage over the credits replacing the original overture) and \"The Happiest Home in These Hills\" were eliminated entirely.\n-Verses from \"I Saw A Dragon,\" \"Passamashloddy,\" \"There's Room For Everyone,\" and \"Every Little Piece\" were cut.\n-21 scenes were shortened.  This version was used for the original home video release in 1980, while every video since then has run 128 minutes, restoring the songs and the majority of dramatic material. However, when Disney re-released it in theaters, it was the European cut. Even further cuts were made for the TV version of the film, which premiered on \"The Disney Sunday Movie\" in 1986.

Fortunately for Pete's Dragon, it contributes something that is essential and valuable to a child's world: fun.There's nothing too serious in Pete's Dragon. Granted, the catalyst for the action in the film is a boy running away from an abusive family, only to encounter an equally abusive society (not to mention a scheming charlatan who wants to capture - and kill - Pete's Dragon for his own monetary gain), but all involved in the production are aware that their target audience is children, and so all of the aforementioned is handled with kid gloves. The best example of this is the acting.The cast does their best to have fun with their character and, as such, contributes greatly to the light-hearted tone of the film. In particular, the villains are played with great, over-the-top gusto, which is exactly what is needed in a kids movie. You want to teach children a lesson, not scare the crap out of them. As such, Shelley Winters as Ma Gogan and Jim Dale as Doc Terminus are classic kiddie villains: Winters stomps through her scenes in a bluster of hilarious hillbilly kookiness, while Dale steals every scene he's in - and nearly the whole show - in a deliciously maniacal role that should have one him an oscar - seriously!Any actor can bring on the tears and boo-hoo their way through an \"emotionally intense\" role; they're a dime a dozen. It takes a real actor to come up with the kind of performance Dale did, in which every line of dialogue is nailed, and his voice and his body seem to be in completely in synch with each other and with the character. There is not one word left untouched by his genius. Especially fun are his interactions with his sidekick, Hoagy, played by Red Buttons. The two are perfect comic foils. They are no matches, however, for the straight-shooting Nora.Nora (Helen Reddy), along with her father Lampie (Mickey Rooney) tend to the local lighthouse. It is in these two characters that children find their protectors. In any kids movie, there needs to be at least one character on screen with which children can find comfort and solace. Reddy plays Nora as a down-to-earth, take no bull lady who becomes a mother figure to Pete. Rooney plays Lampie as a drunken old coot who rides the fence about Pete until about halfway through, at which time he, too, joins the side of good. There's a lesson in this movie for adults, too.Nora and Lampie both learn a little about life from Pete. Nora had decided to keep people at arm's length for fear of losing them (as she did her beau, a seaman who was lost at sea). Through her encounters with Pete, she learns to open up and allow love back into her life, this time in the form of motherly love. Lampie, too, becomes attached to the kid, and, throughout the process of his daughter and Pete bonding, learns that there's more to life than the bottle: there's family. These, really, are important lessons for adults, and ones that are never dated, rather, always applicable to any time and place. So is the lesson for children.At the heart of Pete's Dragon is a simple message for children: hold tight to all that is right, no matter how bad life gets, and good things will come. Pete escapes a horrid life slaving away for the wretched Gogan family, only to run into the arms of a civilized society that looks down on him because of he's an outsider. He's anything but welcomed, and when things start going wrong, he's the first one to be blamed. No matter how hard he tries, society won't believe him, or accept him. He could easily make the wrong choice: give in and become the ruffian they all think he is or, worse, do what society did to him, and turn his back on his friend, Elliot, who is partly to blame for Pete's predicament, as he pulls pranks while he's invisible, leaving Pete to take the rap. In the end, his perseverance pays off: the town embraces him and he gets a family. This lesson is learned, as is to be expected in a musical, with a song and a dance.The musical numbers are by far the weakest element in the movie. The songs are simple, yet they work (believe me, after you watch the movie, you'll find yourself spontaneously singing the choruses the next day). The dancing is the most difficult to digest, as it is often stiff and pointless. That's okay, though, as the story and the acting more than make up for it. When all is said and done, Pete's Dragon is everything a kids movie should be: educating and entertaining.\n\n\n\n\n                27 of 39 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 100 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

During her adventures we also get to meet her talking backpack (or la mochila) and the map who sings an annoyingly cute song. The show plays out almost like a computer adventure showing a mouse on different scenes where the kids make a decision. Dora asks your kids questions and then waits for a response. Dora would then congratulate your child for trying, while replying back with the correct answer to encourage them. The main purpose of the show is to teach Spanish to English-speaking children.\nWritten by\nWillow192 \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n exploration\n|\n pre k audience\n|\n latino american girl\n|\n girl heroine\n|\n breaking the fourth wall\n|\u00a0See All (17)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Dora's last name M\u00e1rquez is revealed in Dora the Explorer: Grandma's House (2000).

Even after enduring a few episodes of this show, I'm still trying to figure out what the creators think they are teaching? The few words of Spanish that are used aren't enough to form simple phrases, so why are they there? Mostly, it seems like they're trying to teach prepositions (up, down, through, etc.) and they're padding it with a few Spanish words to fill out the half-hour episode. I think her parents should keep better tabs on her and around the house more instead of letting her wander through forests and valleys all the time. That, and there's something evil about her eyes.\n\n\n\n\n                28 of 51 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 80 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nIn the human city featured in the film, the signs are in Chinese, and right-hand traffic is used, implying that the film takes place on the north side of the Himalayas in China. However, the city appears to have a population of at least ten thousand, and would therefore have to be on the south side of the Himalayas in India/Nepal/Bhutan, as all of the villages on the north side are much smaller. Also, the overwhelming majority of Himalayan tourism happens on the south side.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nQuotes\nMeechee:\nIt's not just about tearing down old ideas.

The distributor then opted to make 1 seconds of cuts to remove a single use of the term 'crap' in order to lower the film to a U rating.

But the army lieutenant she favors doesn't really appreciate her finer qualities. One of Jane's boasts brings her to Chicago to recruit an actress for the Golden Garter stage. Arrived, the lady in question appears (at first) to be a more feminine rival for the favors of Jane's male friends...including her friendly enemy Wild Bill Hickock.\nWritten by\nRod Crawford <puffinus@u.washington.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n song and dance\n|\n native american attack\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n saloon\n|\n man in drag\n|\u00a0See All (79)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nWarner Bros. sky highest, smile widest, wild and woolliest Western of 'em all!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\u00a0|\n Western\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nGene Nelson was originally announced for one of male leads.

Lovely Technicolor cinematography of the outdoor frontier and rich period costuming enhances this top-notch cornucopia of story, score, and songs- including 'The Deadwood Stage,' 'I Can Do Without You,' 'Windy City,' 'The Subject of Harry,' and 'Secret Love.' Two special moments for me are Howard Keel singing 'Higher Than A Hawk' to the portrait of Allyn McLerie, and 'A Woman's Touch,' which shows McLerie and Doris Day become sisters in solidarity. They clean the house (in fact, renovate it) while discovering Calamity's femininity at the same time. They joke, they bond, and at the end of the scene our heroine is in a dress and quite the looker. There's no shocking sexist message here; it's a musical showing how a woman gets her man. I don't think in 1953 you could've asked for more. On the other hand, most of Day's scenes with Keel are a locked-horns battle of the sexes- absolutely no question. They compliment each other beautifully- from 'I Can Do Without You', right up to their nearly romantic duet of 'The Black Hills of Dakota.' Enjoy the film again, and look between the lines- some of it is quite timeless.\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 14 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 94 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n Was Calamity Jane a real person?\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'Calamity Jane' about?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 4 November 1953 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Schwere Colts in zarter Hand\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nStage 1, Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Warner Bros. \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n101 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(RCA Sound System)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It's a one off. Undoubtedly the best film I have ever seen. I truly laughed until I cried in the cinema showing, bought the video and the soundtrack - which I never do - and have watched it several times over. The political undertones are frighteningly poignant. The idea is brilliant. It's the antidisney. It's a fart in the face of those who wage war in the name of decency. It's a bunch of foul mouthed kids spewing profanity. It's better than good versus evil; it challenges us to asses the criteria upon which we judge good and evil. It pokes fun at everyone, white, black, Jewish, Christian - but particularly the stupid and the bigoted. by ridiculing the fuss that is made against profanity, the writers have safeguarded themselves against adverse publicity from complaints. It's what the film is about in the first place. My only complaint is that this film is so brilliant that it made Team America seem tame.\n\n\n\n\n                90 of 104 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 970 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is the movie about?\n\n\nQ:\n How many profanities are said in this film?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 16 March 2000 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Miasteczko South Park\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$21,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $11,335,889,\n4 July 1999 \n\nGross USA: $52,037,603        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $83,137,603        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Scott Rudin Productions, South Park Studios, Comedy Central \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n81 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n(Digital DTS Sound)| SDDS\n| Dolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n|  Black and White\n(some footage)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Now they bring us \"Teen Beach Movie\", a fun beach party inspired film. McKenzie (Maia Mitchell) and Brady (Ross Lynch) are two surfers who are magically transported inside a classic '60s beach party film, Wet Side Story, where a surf-and-turf war between the surfers and bikers is in full swing. After accidentally changing the film's plot causing the film's hero and heroine to fall for them instead of each other, Mack and Brady must find a way to change the plot back whilst also finding a way back home.The storyline progressed at an easy pace for the audience to follow, while still taking the time to learn about each of the four main characters in detail. The plot line of Wet Side Story, a spoof off of the popular film \"West Side Story\", was both funny and enjoyable to watch. McKenzie's insistence that girls can do anything boys can do provided a great message to the audience, as well as adding extra conflict to the plot.The acting was typical for a Disney Channel Original Movie and most of the cast did a terrific job at over-acting their parts when it came to the Wet Side Story characters. Lynch and Mitchell had very believable chemistry, while Grace Phipps (Lela) and Garrett Clayton (Tanner) did a great job at over-acting their own character's relationship.The film was let down as it was laced with continuity errors. One such error occurred towards the end of the film when Mitchell's hair changed from being up to down from shot to shot. Other errors occurred throughout the film, though this was the most noticeable. The costumes for this film were very similar to those that were used in beach party movies in the '60s. The girls in this film wore high-waisted bikinis which covered their navels, a nod to Ms. Annette Funicello to whom the film was dedicated. The movie's soundtrack was reminiscent of '60s beach party tunes, and contained tracks that were catchy and fun to listen to. 'Can't Stop Singing', sung by Lynch and Mitchell, reflected the plot and worked to parody the genre of movie-musical with lyrics such as 'this can't be happening' and 'don't tell me it's a song'. As we saw back in 2009, Puerto Rico has some beautiful beaches which we got to see again in this film. It's a shame however that in the 'Can't Stop Singing' scene, there was a modern city visible in the background although this part of the film was set in the '60s.With catchy tunes, a progressive storyline and a beautiful location, Disney Channel has once again produced a thoroughly enjoyable film, deserving of the 8/10 rating given.\n\n\n\n\n                2 of 2 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 38 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How can I audition for any Disney Channel shows or work as an extra?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            DisneyNOW\n    \n|\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 26 August 2013 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Gen\u00e7lik Plaj\u0131 Filmi\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nPuerto Rico\n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Disney Channel, Rainforest Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n110 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nStereo\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.78 : 1 / (high definition)\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I brought up that there is something missing from this generation, it seems as if most cartoons or kid's shows today are just lame. I was wondering if I was just saying this because I grew up, but everyone agreed and said there is one show that's proof of that: Animaniacs. We started watching the show again and the interesting thing is, as kids this show was non stop in the laughs department, now as grown ups, it seems like it actually got better. We never realized how much this show was not just meant for the kids as well as the adults as well. Animaniacs is a show that pushed the limits, had great pop culture humor, was great in animation and had the most memorable side characters.Yakko, Wakko and Dot are three God-knows-what that were created for a new cartoon, but when they brought chaos and anarchy to the Warner Brothers Studio. Their films also seemed to make no sense, so they were locked away in the Warner Brothers tower to never be released, but every day they do what they can to escape and have adventures. They have a psychiatrist named Dr. Scratchensniff who is trying to figure out what they are and how they think. They are also constantly chased by the security guard who is trying to protect the head of the Warner Brothers studio from the three crazy little... things.We also have several side characters, starting with Pinky and the Brain. Two lab mice, Brain does the same thing every night as he tries to take over the world with his insane goofy side kick Pinky, who's head isn't screwed on tightly enough. Mindy and Buttons, Mindy is a child who constantly always manages to escape her house and get into a mega amount of trouble while her poor dog Buttons is behind taking all the hits to protect her. Chicken Boo, a giant chicken of many clever disguises. Katie Kaboom, a hormone crazy teenager who looses her temper just a bit too easy and always turns into a giant monster. Rita and Runt, a stranded cat and dog, Rita sings and Runt thinks she's a cool dog. Slappy Squirrel and her nephew Skippy, she's an old cartoon star who's a bit cranky with the way cartoons are made now-a-days. Flavio and Marita, two high class hippo's enjoying the city life. Menerva Mink, quite the looker, who is looking for her true love. Mr. Skullhead who always takes the most random hits for Yakko, Wakko and Dot. And of course, The Goodfeathers, based off of Goodfellas, three pigeons who are trying to be \"coo\" with the city and claim their territory of Statue Scorcesse.Animaniacs is such a classic cartoon, it broke my heart that this show was somehow canceled, I don't know why it was. It brought great laughs and a fun spin off with Pinky and the Brain. There are extremely clever jokes, to pick a favorite skit to someone to ask you if you'd rather be in love or have millions of dollars, it's just too hard to pick. Yeah, I'm a crappy romantic, I know. But Animaniacs is a show that I sincerely miss, if you ever get the chance to see it, please take it! It's so funny to see all the jokes that you laughed as a kid then grow up to get the real meaning behind it.\n\n\n\n\n                58 of 63 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 69 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Out of the tragedy, a savior emerges: GeneCo, a biotech company that offers organ transplants, for a price. Those who miss their payments are scheduled for repossession and hunted by villainous Repo Men. In a world where surgery addicts are hooked on painkilling drugs and murder is sanctioned by law, a sheltered young girl searches for the cure to her own rare disease as well as information about her family's mysterious history. After being sucked into the haunting world of GeneCo, she is unable to turn back, as all of her questions will be answered at the wildly anticipated spectacular event: The Genetic Opera.\nWritten by\nLionsgate \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n gore\n|\n violence\n|\n repossession\n|\n future\n|\n surgery\n|\u00a0See All (220)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAssassin.

At one point (just after the Graverobber pulls the needle out of his pack and before he says \"Lest it be you on the concrete below\"), she leans on the tombstone and it moves.

The creators thought that how the movie started was too slow so they decided to take the song 'Genetic Repoman' that was suppose to play at the end of the film and put it at the very beginning. Then they cut the scene Thing's You See in a Graveyard into two separate parts and played part 1 after Genetic Repoman. This gave the film more of a bigger and dramatic opening.

The film was phenomenal! It was beautiful to watch and extremely entertaining. Repo far surpasses the Saw films in originality, creativity, and artistic integrity. This is not simply a slasher film, although there is plenty of violence to keep gore fans happy, there is a very interesting and unique story being told here. In fact, a whole world has been created in Repo and there is plenty of room for more stories to follow. Unlike many sequels, a sequel to Repo would be completely justified in respect to its content.The music was catchy and I walked back to the hotel with it running through my head. There is a nice variety of songs featured in Repo and, as is natural with a collection of songs, fans will have their favorites and their least favorites. I can honestly say that even my least favorite songs were still necessary in the context of the film and I didn't really mind them. I was slightly caught off guard by how pop a couple of the musical numbers were, but again they were appropriate for the part of the film they were featured in.Another surprise was the size of roles in the film. The roles played by Ogre, Bill Moseley, and Paris Hilton were not as prominent as I had imagined them being (and yes Paris gave a good performance). They seemed to have less screen time than the rest of the stars. This is not a serious complaint of the film itself, just a desire for more (especially Ogre). Skinny Puppy fans have never seen Ogre quite like this (just wait until you hear his voice). Other personal favorites (aside from Ogre) were The Grave Robber, Anthony Head, and Sarah Brightman.Darren, the Cast and Crew, and the Producers of Repo the Genetic Opera have created a beautiful thing here. This is a horror movie with true originality in story and in visuals. They went out on a limb to make something new, something that hasn't already been proved to work and that type of effort needs to be supported; otherwise we will continue to be given \"New\" movies that it feels like we have seen before. I know the wait has been long, but I can now tell you with certainty that it is well worth the wait.If originality is not supported it will continue to disappear.Please support Repo the Genetic Opera.\n\n\n\n\n                131 of 189 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 288 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What songs are used in the trailer?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 20 November 2008 (Czech Republic)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Foniki synallagi\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nCinespace Film Studios, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$8,500,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $53,684,\n9 November 2008 \n\nGross USA: $146,750        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $188,126        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Twisted Pictures, Burg/Koules Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n98 min\n|\n150 min\n            (original cut)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

On his first day back at Airflow, he gets sidetracked by thoughts of a young woman who literally rollerskates into him. He's unaware that their initial encounter and subsequent encounters are not accident: she is Kira, a muse who was awakened by his lamentations about his art and sent to help him achieve his artistic vision. Later that day he meets aging Danny McGuire, a former big-band musician turned construction-company owner who wants to return to his roots by owning a live music venue. This meeting too is no accident; Sonny soon discovers that Kira was part of Danny's past. Sonny and Danny achieving their dreams is threatened by Kira knowingly breaking the rules.\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n dancer\n|\n muse\n|\n disco\n|\n roller skates\n|\n roller disco\n|\u00a0See All (68)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nOlivia!

The 1994 VHS release (while retaining the Universal logo at the end), strangely replaces the PG rating slide with a GP rating slide (the original name for the PG rating from 1969 to 1972). The 1999 DVD restores the proper PG rating slide, however the 1963 Universal logo is removed. The 2008 DVD restores both the 1963 Universal logo and the original PG rating slide, making it a more accurate representation of the original theatrical release.

But all that being said, I would like to offer a minority opinion, and say that I didn't find the film THAT terrible, and there are some aspects of it I actually enjoyed...First and foremost, it offers the legendary Gene Kelly, in his last musical, as charming and wonderful as ever. As retired musician/businessman Danny McGuire, Kelly has the film's best moments, including a 'classic' song-and-dance scene with Olivia Newton-John and some silly but endearing 'post-disco' routines with the talented young dancers of the cast (including future CONAN star Sandahl Bergman). Seeing him on roller-skates again, leading everyone around the club he builds, to the music of the Electric Light Orchestra, makes one realize just how irreplaceable he is. Kelly could do it all, and with style!The premise of the film, of a Muse coming from Olympus to inspire an artist, is far-fetched, but had been done on film several times in the past (ONE TOUCH OF VENUS, with Ava Gardner and Robert Walker, and DOWN TO EARTH, with Rita Hayworth, are the examples most often cited), and while Olivia Newton-John is oddly cast in the role, she tackles it gamely, with a smile and a wink, and isn't THAT bad. On the other hand, Michael Beck, best-known as the gang leader in cliched but powerful THE WARRIORS, is totally miscast as the artist she falls in love with. An actor with limited range and no singing or dancing talent, Beck lacks the charisma to pull off the role (one wonders why British pop star Cliff Richard, who voices Beck's animated duet with Newton-John, 'Suddenly', wasn't utilized to play the part).While the film often veers off in bizarre directions, the 'Battle of the Bands' scene between popular 80s rockers, the Tubes, and a 'Tommy Dorsey/WWII'-style orchestra (as Beck and Kelly envision what the 'look' and 'sound' of their club, XANADU, should be), actually works, and is fun to watch. The entire score, by Barry De Vorzon and John Farrar, and Jeff Lynne (with ELO) is terrific (and made the soundtrack album a hit).Sure, the ending is hokey, but it was also the same ending of ONE TOUCH OF VENUS and DOWN TO EARTH, so XANADU can't be totally faulted!All in all, XANADU isn't the WORST film ever made, and if you give it a chance, you might find it a guilty pleasure!\n\n\n\n\n                165 of 183 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 333 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is there a connection between this film and the song by Rush?

Deanna Oliver went through the entire production believing she was voicing a girl and was never told otherwise. In the original book, the toaster explicitly did not have one, as with all the other appliances.

This has been edited so she is wearing a bikini top (the inside corners of which actually match the stars in shape). This affects at least the US 2003 DVD and c. 1998 VHS releases, but not the c. 1991 laserdisc.

My young nieces are just starting to grow out of that stage, which is sort of sad to me. Because never again will their minds be able to dwell within and without the fantasy world. This film captures that sort of mindset wonderfully. Of *course* the appliances get up and walk around as soon as we turn our backs. That's why we can never find anything!Seems like a lot of people who have posted here have made one of two mistakes:1) They have forgotten that children's minds have not yet been clobbered into creative submission like adults', or2) The adults didn't watch the movie before plunking their kids down in front of the TV and going back to regrouting the tub.While this is a fantasy about appliances, it is also a film about loyalty, companionship, and even fear. There are several disturbing scenes but I think many kids will find it intriguing more than scary. And if they do find it frightening, then it's a good way to discuss the things that scare them.\nThis film is mostly for kids, but I think it has plenty of stuff to keep the adults awake, especially \"Rabbit Ears\", the black & white TV guy (look closely at some of the pictures he pulls out of the file cabinet). This film is infinitely better than other Disney films like \"The Little Mermaid\" and that sort of claptrap.\n\n\n\n\n                37 of 40 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 75 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

But Alexander's dream of signing Josie to a recording contract meets resistance from Cabot Media's powerful senior vice president Alexandra, who also happens to be his twin sister. Josie and Katy's roommate, Jorge, works at his family's bodega and has his eye on Broadway, but after a series of rejections, he hopes to take his drag performance career as Ginger to the next level. The mysterious Pepper Smith plans to open her own version of Andy Warhol's Factory. She has the connections, but no one seems to know where she got her money or if she really has any at all. As these aspiring artists take on the runway, the recording studio, Broadway and the New York social scene, they find more than just a career in the big city -- they find long-lasting friendship.\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n archie comics\n|\n shared universe\n|\n based on comic\n|\n based on comic book\n|\n new york city\n|\u00a0See All (13)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA high-fashion fairytale        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Set in the same universe as Riverdale and The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.

BUT THE FASHION I love and the acting is good. The story lines are alright, love the drag element and the shots of NYC are great. I just think if they cut a couple of the songs it would be better.\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 8 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 61 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Terri has a love of singing and making up her own songs. Her brother (before his death) secretly submits a DVD of her singing to a musical summer camp down in L.A. Her father doesn't want her to go, but secretly her mom lets her go and everything goes fine, except she has stage fright. She gets through her stage fright with the help of her new friend Jay. At the end of the contest everyone at the musical school have to perform something. And if they win, they win a scholarship along with it. Her dad finds out, comes down to L.A. and threatens to take her home! Will he let her stay? and will she win the contest? Viewers are on the edges of their seats to find out what happens...\nWritten by\nEmily Moore \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n actress\n|\n band music\n|\n english\n|\n teenage boy\n|\n small town\n|\u00a0See All (46)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nDon't give up.

The summer program in LA the Terri attends is in August.

And it's a shame that the cute, miscast Hilary Duff doesn't have the singing talents to play the young outstanding vocalist in the making, who goes to the school against her over-protective father's wishes. As she is the \"star\" at the school, she gets the four-minute musical final\u00e9 while the other competitors only get 15 seconds of silver screen moments when everyone ultimately competes for the reward, go figure! Plot holes and inconsistencies abound, but its heart is in the right place.\n\n\n\n\n                5 of 8 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 210 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

On a hunting trip he falls in on Merlin, a powerful but amnesiac wizard who has plans for Wart beyond mere squiredom. He starts by trying to give Wart an education (whatever that is), believing that once one has an education, one can go anywhere. Needless to say, it doesn't quite work out that way.\nWritten by\nTim Pickett <quetzal@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n wizard\n|\n sword\n|\n owl\n|\n orphan\n|\n castle\n|\u00a0See All (168)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nIt's merry old England and a brand new Pooh!

Today feature films are quite funny too... but they based mostly on simple, crude jokes and spoofing of other topical movies (remember the bullet time-spoof in \"Shrek\"). There is no substance to think about in it. You can see them, laughing about them...and forgot them almost completely a few years later. Who will remember, i.e., \"Ice Age\" or \"Madagascar\" in 40, 50 or 60 years? The old Disney classics are different, there are timeless! \"The Sword in the Stone\" contains a lot of joyful gags too, but no gag stands above the characters, no joke was made only to fill a hole in the plot. The story, the plot, and the characters are primary. And Disney add not only joyful gags. As Walt himself once said: \"For every laugh, there should be a tear.\" Disney take children always quite seriously, and a lot of his early films contains a lesson for life, sometimes the lesson can be very sad and cruel, like in \"Bambi\", sometimes lesser sad, like in \"The Sword in the Stone\"... but can anybody forget the cute little girl squirrel, that was left by Wart, desperately crying and with a broken heart? And Merlin's closing words about love: \"Well, yes, in its own way... yes, I'd say it's the most powerful force on Earth\"!This is one of the main ingredient of the famous Disney Magic: Joy and tragedy! Another is the art of hand drawn animation. The quality of the animation went downwards at Disney after WW-II too, slowly, but surely. But in 1963 cel-animation was still on a high level. Not so good as in the golden Era, when \"Fantasia\", \"Pinocchio\" or especially \"Bambi\" set the utmost high standards of perfectionism, but quite better than in \"Hercules\", \"The Lion King\" or \"The Rescuers down under\". 7 of 10 stars for \"The Sword in the Stone\"! It is not the best of all Disney films, but quite better and deeper than the most of the modern CGI movies!\n\n\n\n\n                55 of 69 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 104 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is the British DVD version really censored?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Disney's Official Site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 21 June 1964 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: La espada en la piedra\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$3,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $2,230,614,\n27 March 1983 \n\nGross USA: $12,000,000        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $12,000,000        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney Animation Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n79 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(RCA Sound Recording)| Dolby Stereo\n(1983 Re-Release)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.75 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The boys seem to be constantly on the run, from their crazed fans and from their manager, who is constantly trying to rein them in. Sir Ringo Starr however is arrested and still isn't in the studio half an hour before air time. With Sir Paul McCartney's grandfather available for additional comical relief, the group performs a dozen or so songs.\nWritten by\ngarykmcd \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n the beatles\n|\n beatlemania\n|\n rock 'n' roll\n|\n 1960s\n|\n man in a bathtub\n|\u00a0See All (138)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nSoaring in their first, full-length, hilarious, action-packed film!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    As Ringo was not a formally trained drummer and as he rarely played any Latin-influenced music, he is not using the bongos properly. The one with the smaller head (the \"macho\" or male drum) should be at his left and the one with the larger head \"hembra\" or female drum) should be at his right. This is because in most Latin rhythms the macho does most of the \"yelling\", interrupted by the hembra, which interjects a lower \"calming\" note. As most people are right-handed, the hand that goes back and forth between drums is the right, while the left hand stays on the left drum.

The penguin pulls out a set of animated Beatles from its chest, who briefly play their music and then run away from fangirls.

In the 30th anniversary special on the making of the film, the cut scene featuring the song is shown after the special.

A black and white production that relies upon the music and personalities of The Beatles. It has a 'loose' plot, The Beatles' lives over a 48-hour period, looking after Paul's grandfather, which serves as an excuse for hi-jinks and bursting into song. Directed by Richard Lester, it manages to convey the social feel of its time, what it is like to be alone, ageing, class divisions, and an England that does not exist any more. It is witty,nostalgic and makes you aware of how fresh The Beatles were before they (and the 60's) got complicated.Here are some of lines from the film, whether they were scripted or spontaneous I know not, but it doesn't detract from the humour:Who's that little old man? Ringo: He belongs to Paul.I shall call the guard. Paul: Ah, but what? They don't take kindly to insults.Have you seen Paul's grandfather? John: Of course! he's concealed about me person.They've gone potty out there. The place is surging with girls. John: Please sir, can I have one to surge with sir?What would you call that hairstyle that you're wearing? George: Arthur.George (about Ringo): He's very fussy about his drums you know. They loom large in his legend.Well quite frankly I wasn't expecting a musical arranger to question my ability picture-wise. John: I could listen to him for hours.If you ever wanted to have lived during the 60's a film like this epitomises why. There's a really lively night club scene where you get to watch, almost like a 'fly on the wall', The Beatles being themselves.Watch it, buy the Hard Day's Night Album and drift away into a pleasant and sentimental 60's daydream.\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 6 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 258 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is \"A Hard Day's Night\" about?\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n Is this movie set (A Hard Days Night), where George Harrison met his future wife Patty Boyd (Jean, in the movie) ?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGerman\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 7 July 1964 (UK)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: 4 Gar\u00e7ons dans le vent\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMarylebone Station, Marylebone, London, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$560,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $50,445,\n3 December 2000 \n\nGross USA: $1,480,356        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $2,360,561        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walter Shenson Films, Proscenium Films \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n87 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(RCA Sound Recording)    \n\nColor:\n Black and White\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.66 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Once more, against the colourful backdrop of the iconic late-1950s Rydell High, the riotous gang of greasers, the T-Birds, and Betty Rizzo's delightfully sassy posse, the Pink Ladies, battle for attention, thirsting to become the coolest teams in school. Undoubtedly, this is going to be yet another year filled with passion, innocence, dance, affection, and teen energy, as the students set their mind on excelling in the much-awaited live dance contest. In this high school graduation day, GREASE is still the word.\nWritten by\nNick Riganas \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n drive in theater\n|\n first day at a new school\n|\n new in school\n|\n exclamation point in title\n|\n greaser\n|\u00a0See All (72)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAn electrifying LIVE television event!        \n\n\nGenres:\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The opening credits of \"Grease: Live\" specifically attributes its script to Bront\u00e9 Woodard's screenplay for the 1978 film, as adapted by producer Alan Carr. A following credit refers to the stage play by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey, but this new version is not based on (or an adaptation of) the play. It is essentially a remake of the film.

As they headed into commercial breaks, Mario Lopez narrated several short behind-the-scenes/making-of segments which were omitted from the DVD.

Well done.\nThe guy playing Danny is not a good actor, and he looks about 40 years old.\nI know this is live, but it felt rushed and forced. Almost like they were just saying the words from the original film but not actually acting. And I love Keke Palmer, she's so funny usually, but she overacted this part. Marty is supposed to be a a ditzy character, but that didn't come across here. Almost like she was playing someone completely different. Julianne Hough is actually a better Sandy than Olivia, sorry to say. Some of the extras added were great, some unnecessary. I loved the Sandy cheerleading tryout scene. However they shouldn't have added so much extra if they were pressed for time.\nThe dance sequences were fantastic, I must say. So a really good remake, however had it not been a live show, would have been twice as good.\n\n\n\n\n                1 of 1 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 62 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

While I went in thinking it might be an enjoyable watch when I've got nothing better to do, I've now seen the whole first season and am on the edge of my seat waiting for more! The animation is pleasing to watch, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are diverse and have well-written and intriguing backstories, and the overall feel is exciting and fun, but with darker undertones that really ramp-up the experience for older viewers. On top of all that being enough to keep me engaged, the music is exceptionally well-chosen and clearly had a lot of thought put into it, giving me a mixed vibe of Steven Universe's Rebecca Sugar songs, and oddly enough, the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack. Overall I'd say this is a great family show for tween/teenaged kids and any adult looking for a playful escape that isn't mindless like many cartoons made nowadays.\n\n\n\n\n                34 of 41 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 108 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Will \"Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeats\" end here in season three after ep. 10.\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            DreamWorks Animation\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 14 January 2020 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Kipo y la era de los magnimales\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA\n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n DreamWorks Animation Television \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n24 min\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Instead of real bullets they use \"splurge guns\" that cover the victim in cream. The story tells of the rise of \"Bugsy Malone\" and the battle for power between \"Fat Sam\" and \"Dandy Dan\".\nWritten by\nSteve Crook <steve@brainstorm.co.uk> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n all child cast\n|\n gangster\n|\n new york city\n|\n directorial debut\n|\n singing\n|\u00a0See All (81)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nYou're going to hug the mug called Bugsy Malone.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Crime\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Over a thousand cream pies were thrown during the making of the movie.

But believe you's me, he should've never taken that blind alley by the side of Parido's Bakery.

ITV Studios was formed in 2009 by the merger of Granada Productions and Carlton International. Ironically, the DVD case cover lists a 94 minute runtime and the Blu-ray case cover lists an 89 minute runtime. The only differences between the two presentations, once the 18 seconds for the Granada International logo clip is subtracted from the BD time, is (1) after the Rank gong is struck the second time, the text \"The RANK ORGANISATION presents\" is superimposed over the gong in the BD version while the text \"THE RANK ORGANISATION\" is superimposed over the gong in the DVD version, (2) the DVD runs the movie about 4% faster than the Blu-ray disc, and (3) the DVD has 1.33:1 aspect (640 pixels x 480 pixels), letter boxed on all four sides to 1.62:1 aspect ratio (596 pixels x 367 pixels) while the BD has 1.78:1 aspect (1920 pixels x 1080 pixels). Both disc conversions appear to have used \"pan and scan\" cropping from the film's 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Sometimes the cropping appears similar, but other times, one may crop the height mostly from the top while the other mostly from the bottom. The feature on the Blu-ray disc runs at 24 Hz. Although the DVD runs at 60 Hz, the speed-up is similar to the 4.3% speed-up when 24 frame/second film is transferred to 50 Hz Pal format using 2:2 pulldown and may point to a 50 Hz master in its past.

Pies instead of bullets.\n\n                        22 January 2001 | by copycat-5\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nI watched this movie in the mid-1980's when I was around 6 or 7.  I just loved it.  I recently got a chance to watch it again on television and it brought back memories.  When I watched it as a child I didn't know who Jodie Foster or Scott Baio was.  Now that I'm in my 20's I realized that they were in the movie.  I love this movie because I loved it when I was younger.  I don't know what my impression would've been if my first viewing was in my adult years.  This movie is kind of corny but for kids it's hilarious.  I love the songs!  I remember I use to tape record them and play them over and over till the tape wore out.\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 8 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 99 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

On V.E. Day, Nora gives birth to their son, who she names Tommy. While Tommy is an adolescent, Nora marries Frank, a shifty camp counselor. Shortly thereafter, Tommy suffers an emotionally traumatic experience associated with his father and step-father, which, based on things told to him at that time, results in him becoming deaf, dumb and blind, a situation which several people exploit for their own pleasure. As Nora tries several things to bring Tommy out of his psychosomatic disabilities, Tommy, now a young man, happens upon pinball as a stimulus. Playing by intuition, Tommy becomes a pinball master, which in turn makes him, and by association Nora and Frank, rich and famous. Nora literally shatters Tommy to his awakening, which ultimately leads to both the family's rise and downfall as people initially try to emulate Tommy's path then rebel against it.\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n pinball\n|\n holiday camp\n|\n murder\n|\n jukebox musical\n|\n the who\n|\u00a0See All (43)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nNow a New Experience in TRI-PHONIC SOUND                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Ann-Margret won the Best Actress Golden Globe for her performance, was nominated for the Oscar, and remains to this day the only actress ever Oscar-nominated in the lead category for a performance which is (save for one single word) entirely sung.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nDuring Ann-Margaret's \"Rain Champagne\" scene, the bottle of champagne she is 'drinking' from is clearly empty. Several times in the scene, it is lying on its side on the floor, yet nothing flows from it and during the close-ups where she is supposed to be drinking from the bottle, you can see that there is nothing inside it.

In the American version, the green filter effect is not present which means this effect was added at some point during post production.

I guess that it's hard to adapt something like that to the silver screen. But even so, this movie is an experience unlike any other. Watching it, you try to figure out how to digest all that you're seeing and make sense of it (although I would reject calling it sensory overload).The plot of course has deaf, dumb, blind Tommy Walker (Roger Daltrey) becoming a pinball champion and developing a cult following. Daltrey has no trouble getting into the role, especially when he sings \"I'm Free\". Equally good - and quite perceptive - is Ann-Margret as his mother Nora, using his celebrity to enrich herself; I really liked the scene where she hallucinates soap, beans and chocolate pouring out of the TV set. Oliver Reed seems a little bit wooden as Frank, whom Nora marries when she hears that her husband has gotten killed in WWII, but he still passes. Tina Turner really goes over the top as the Acid Queen, who tries to cure Tommy. Elton John is OK as the Pinball Wizard, but I guess that anyone could have done that role. Probably the most surprising cast member is Jack Nicholson as The Specialist; I mean, who would have ever imagined Jack Nicholson of all people in a musical?* Peter Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon also appear.All in all, director Ken Russell instills this movie with the same sensibility that we find in the rest of his movies. Maybe it seemed better in the cinema, with its quintaphonic sound. But it's still something that I recommend to everyone. In conclusion: See it...feel it...touch it...heal it.*Just imagine musical versions of \"Five Easy Pieces\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"The Shining\" and \"As Good As It Gets\"!\n\n\n\n\n                15 of 20 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 207 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Unbeknownst to them, this is all part of the sinister plan of Constantine, the world's most evil frog, to become the greatest thief of all time. After making sure that Kermit is jailed as him, Constantine impersonates him to use the Muppets' tour as cover for his scheme. While Sam the Eagle and Inspector Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) investigate, the Muppets find their boss seems strangely changed even as Kermit desperately attempts to escape to stop the impostor. Only when Walter, Fozzie, and Animal realize the truth is there a chance to prevent Constantine from pulling off the crime of the century.\nWritten by\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com) \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n prison break\n|\n puppet\n|\n gulag\n|\n europe\n|\n fairy godmother character\n|\u00a0See All (41)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nTaking the world by farce                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Crime\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Mystery\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some mild action\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nTina Fey and voice performer Matt Vogel prepared with a dialect coach for their roles of Nadya and Constantine.

I'm not saying that Muppets Most Wanted is as good as the original three, or date say better. But it is as close to Muppet-Greatness as we've been since Jim Henson's passing.The writers found that perfect balance between silly and witty. The plot centered around the beloved original characters, while introducing a hilarious new villain. The musical numbers had that uplifting, old-school feel and never induced cringing.We finally have a post-Henson Muppet Movie that will stand the test of time. Rejoice!\n\n\n\n\n                27 of 38 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 130 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How many previous Muppets movies were there?\n\n\nQ:\n What is written on the Lemur's coin?\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Extended Cut?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n|\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nGerman\n\n\nRelease Date: 27 March 2014 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ha'khaboubot mevoukashot\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nPinewood Studios, Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$50,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $17,005,126,\n23 March 2014 \n\nGross USA: $51,183,113        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $80,383,113        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Pictures, Mandeville Films, Babieka \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n107 min\n|\n119 min\n            (\"Unnecessarily Extended\" Edition)\n          |\n124 min\n            (extended cut)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDatasat\n| Dolby Digital\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n|  Black and White\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Gaston, the scion of a wealthy Parisian family finds emotional refuge from the superficial lifestyle of upper class Parisian 1900s society with the former mistress of his uncle and her outgoing, tomboy granddaughter, Gigi. When Gaston becomes aware that Gigi has matured into a woman, her grandmother and aunt, who have educated Gigi to be a wealthy man's mistress, urge the pair to act out their roles but love adds a surprise twist to this delightful turn-of-the 20th century Cinderella story.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n 1900s\n|\n singing\n|\n singer\n|\n paris france\n|\n ennui\n|\u00a0See All (108)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe New Screen Musical in Gorgeous Color by the Composer of \"My Fair Lady\"                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Leslie Caron was one of few performers in the MGM stock company who graduated to greater heights through studio training and her own innate gifts: When she arrived in 1950, she was a ballet dancer, barely fluent in English, who had never before spoken dialogue or appeared on camera. After only four films, she earned a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for Lili (1953). By the time of Gigi (1958), Caron has grown into a seasoned actress -- indeed, she does not dance a step in the film -- and she would leave musicals behind her entirely, giving brilliant performances in Fanny (1961), The L-Shaped Room (1962) and Is Paris Burning? (1966).

Visually he resumes singing only on the final \"for little girls.\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nQuotes\n[first lines]\n[Honore walks through Paris and greets the viewer]\nHonore Lachaille:\nGood afternoon! As you see, this lovely city all around us is Paris, and this lovely park is of course the Bois de Boulogne. Who am I? Well, allow me to introduce myself: I am Honore Lachaille. Born: Paris. When...\n[laughs]\nHonore Lachaille:\n...not lately. This is 1900, so let's just say not in this century. Circumstances: comfortable. Profession: lover, and collector of beautiful things. Not antiques mind you, younger things.\n[...] See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nIn some prints shown on television, we see still photos of Leslie Caron part of the time during the song \"Gigi\", instead of seeing Louis Jourdan singing. (This occurs after the verse and first chorus, when the orchestra plays the song while Jourdan only exclaims \"Gigi!\") As shown currently, we see Jourdan singing throughout the whole song, as in the theatrical release.

And that's not the only similarity. The songs all have a \"My Fair Lady\" similarity -- from 'The Night They Invented Champagne' to 'Gigi' to 'The Parisiennes' -- all bear the flavor of their previous work in sound and content. And yet they work beautifully for this story set in the city of love and starring Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan, Herminone Gingold and Maurice Chevalier.Production-wise, it's almost too lavish for its own good. Vincente Minnelli wrings every bit of artistic decor in the trappings, giving the viewer an almost claustrophobic feeling for the interior scenes. The outdoor shots are just as lavish--Louis Jourdan singing the title song among the fountains and architecture of French landmarks. The cast is perfect. Leslie Caron makes an enchanting Gigi, Louis Jourdan is impossibly handsome as Gaston, and all of the other players were cast with a discerning eye.But there is no denying that no matter how distasteful some will find the story of training a girl to become a courtesan to be (or how politically incorrect by today's standards), the score is as sparkling as the champagne they sing about. While, in my opinion, the score does not surpass \"My Fair Lady\" in range and cleverness, it certainly did well enough in winning nine Oscars, including the one for Best Picture of 1958. By all means, it has to be considered one of the last great musicals from the MGM period.Only drawback: it's a bit overlong and could have used some editing for the slow moments.\n\n\n\n\n                27 of 37 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 145 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Any recommendations for other movies similar to 'Gigi'?\n\n\nQ:\n What was the card game that Gigi and Gaston were playing?\n\n\nQ:\n How old was Gigi supposed to be?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n\n\nRelease Date: 25 June 1958 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: \u0416\u0438\u0436\u0438\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nAuberge de la Mouti\u00e8re - 14 Rue Mouti\u00e8re, Montfort-l'Amaury, Yvelines, France\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$3,319,355\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n115 min\n            (Turner library print)\n            (copyright length)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\n4-Track Stereo\n(Westrex Recording System)| Perspecta Stereo\n| Mono\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n(Metrocolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Coming to terms with the reality of it all, Troy wants to attend the nearby University of Albuquerque next year on a basketball scholarship, but Gabriella wants to attend Stanford University in California. Meanwhile, Sharpay, the school's shallow and spoiled rich girl, plots to go all out planning the school's final musical show with the idea to add music to her hopes and fears about the future. While Sharpay takes an up-and-coming British exchange student under her wing, her flamboyant fraternal twin brother, Ryan, has his sights set on something different after school. In addition, Troy's best friend and basketball teammate Chad, and Garbiella's best friend Taylor, all have their sights set on their plans after high school and come to terms with the reality of the real world.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n disney acid sequence\n|\n high school\n|\n basketball\n|\n graduation\n|\n high school senior\n|\u00a0See All (45)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nhigh school graduation        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    All of the original songs from the film were listed among the 49 eligible songs for nomination at the 81st Academy Awards in the Best Original Song category, with special notice towards the songs \"I Want It All,\" \"Can I Have This Dance,\" \"A Night to Remember,\" and \"Scream.\" Ultimately, none of the songs were nominated, though \"Last Chance\" (which was part of the compilation song \"Senior Year Spring Musical\") was performed during the ceremony as a part of a tribute to songs from movie musicals.

The rest, Chad(Corbin Bleau), and Ryan(Lucas Grabeel), I felt did not have much to work with, they where in and out for the most part.But it did have amazing dance numbers and had great songs, like the first two did, but Effron, Hudgens, and Tisdale just keep repeating themselves. It's entertaining at times dragging. I'll bet the cast is ready to move on after this one, I could see it on most of there faces. It was alright, but not exciting and energetic has the first two.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 17 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 193 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Where is Gabriella's dad?\n\n\nQ:\n Is this the last High School Musical?\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the theatrical cut and the extended cut?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 23 October 2008 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: High School Musical 3\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nEast High School - 840 S 1300 E, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$11,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $42,030,184,\n26 October 2008 \n\nGross USA: $90,559,416        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $252,909,177        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Pictures, Borden and Rosenbush Entertainment \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n112 min\n|\n118 min\n            (extended edition)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| Dolby Digital\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Only Jim Cummings reprises his roles for that film as Pooh Bear,and Tigger respectively, whilst the other characters have different voice actors from their animated appearances (eg. Nick Mohammed voices Piglet instead of Travis Oates and Toby Jones voices Owl instead of either Andre Stojka and Craig Ferguson and Brad Garrett voices Eeyore instead of either Peter Cullen or Bud Luckey and Sophie Okonedo voices Kanga instead of either Kath Soucie and Kristen Anderson-Lopez Sara Sheen voices Roo instead of Wyatt Dean Hall and Peter Capaldi voices Rabbit instead of Tom Kenny. Chris O'Dowd was originally set to voice Tigger instead of Jim Cummings but Cummings took over in the final film alongside Pooh Bear after test audiences turned down O'Dowd's take on the character).

She threatens to leave when the house she had been promised is not available, but falls in love with the children. A new slave, a gift of a vassal king, translates \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" into a Siamese ballet. After expressing her unhappiness at being with the King, the slave decides to make an attempt to escape with her lover. Anna and the King start to fall in love, but her headstrong upbringing inhibits her from joining his harem. She is just about to leave Siam but something important she finds out makes her think about changing her mind.\nWritten by\nRandy Goldberg <goldberg@nymc.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n siam\n|\n year 1862\n|\n englishwoman abroad\n|\n bare chested male\n|\n ship captain\n|\u00a0See All (80)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nMore than your eyes have ever seen...

The film stops, a quick reel change slide is put up, and then the real movie starts.

It was removed on later VHS releases, starting with the 1994 VHS release.

Great picture for children as well. Be brave young lovers, so eloquently done, in a masterful production producing yet another Oscar losing nomination for Deborah Kerr. 1956 was a big year for Brynner. Besides this great film, where he received the best actor Oscar, he also appeared in \"The Ten Commandments,\" and \"Anastasia.\"\n\n\n\n\n                16 of 19 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 104 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n Do Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner do their own singing?\n\n\nQ:\n From what did the king die?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nThai\n\n\nRelease Date: 29 June 1956 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ha-Melech V'Anni\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nCentury City, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$4,550,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $65        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Twentieth Century Fox \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n133 min\n|\n144 min\n            (with Overture, Entr'acte and Exit Music)\n            (roadshow)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\n4-Track Stereo\n(Westrex Recording System)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.55 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

No. \nIs it as bad as the reviews make it seem? No.\nThe show has amazing music, personally better than Empire. The storyline has a lot of twists and turns. I say give the show ATLEAST a try longer then 2 episodes. What can a show tell in 2 episodes? The show evolves well in my opinion. The singing and acting is good as well.\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 12 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 57 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What songs appear on Star?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 14 December 2016 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Lee Daniels' Star\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nAtlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Lee Daniels Entertainment, 20th Century Fox Television \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n42 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nStereo\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 HD\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Meanwhile, while Troy starts hanging out with the rich folk, Chad is worried that Troy will forget his friends. Gabriella feels as though she is losing Troy to Sharpay.

Yet, a sequel was inevitable and it doesn't have the same flow as the original.High School Musical 2 takes place a year after Troy (Zac Efron) and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) became an item to the school where now its summer time with the majority of all the East High Wildcats having plans for summer jobs. Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) and her dweeby brother Ryan (Lucas Grabrel) have plans for the summer with the bratty sister wanting her eyes on the prize: Troy. She'll do anything to get it, even if it means hiring Troy at a country club where he'll work if he can get the East High Cats to work there also, including friends Chad (Corbin Bleu), Taylor (Monique Coleman), Kelsi (Olesya Rulin) and his sweetie, Gabriella.The good: Ashley Tisdale's performance was gritty and did not change one bit throughout the film as the evil Sharpey Evans. To be honest, it is the best performance out of film compared to on looker Zac Efron.The OK: The soundtrack itself isn't the same as the original though only a couple of songs are worth hearing from Ashley Tisdale's \"Fabolous\" to the duet of Zanessa (Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens) Gotta Go My Own Way.The Bad: In my opinion the film would've been better if everybody including the protagonist (Zac) had better screen time like in the original movie. Even during the conflicts all of the major characters from Gabriella, Taylor and Chad have little less screen time and giving them sappy lines where in the end, all is forgiven.To Conclude: Maybe the third movie will be the charm.\n\n\n\n\n                11 of 24 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 185 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

In New York, she fixes Vandergelder's clerks up with the woman Vandergelder had been courting, and her shop assistant (Dolly has designs of her own on Mr. Vandergelder, you see).\nWritten by\nRandy Goldberg <goldberg@nymc.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n year 1890\n|\n matchmaker\n|\n new york city\n|\n widow\n|\n based on stage musical\n|\u00a0See All (32)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The only Best Picture Oscar nominee that year to be also nominated for Best Original or Adaptation Score.

They occur as Dolly Levi (played by Barbra Streisand) is running down the garden path to see the parade and is singing the line \"Before the Parade Passes by\".In the 35mm prints which were sent to movie theaters after the roadshow engagements, Dolly almost loses her hat while running. This was used for the home video version. The 70mm prints have a different take, in which Dolly did not have any hat problems. This was used for the DVD version.

Producer Ernest Lehman adapted his screenplay from the popular stage musical with a book by Michael Stewart, based on Thornton Wilder's \"The Matchmaker\" (itself filmed without music in 1958). Director Gene Kelly attempts a breathless pace right from the start, which leaves the early scenes feeling rushed and hyperactive. Professional critics in late 1969, perhaps put off by the unimaginable-for-its-time $25 million budget, complained that the picture was overblown; however, in hindsight, this is inconsequential, as the scenario begs for a huge presentation...and a huge star in the lead. Barbra Streisand (deemed too young to be portraying a widow) is a marvelous Dolly: a firebrand (and a firecracker) who knows nothing of subtlety, she goes for the gut, as the role requires. As her reluctant intended, Walter Matthau looks unhappy and seems stuffy, but repeat viewings reveal this to be the character and not necessarily Matthau's disposition at the time (he and Streisand failed to get along while filming). The song numbers, particularly \"Just Leave Everything To Me\", \"Before The Parade Passes By\" and the celebrated title tune, are joyous, and Michael Kidd's line-'em-up choreography is often stunning in widescreen. The film does run too long, and it loses some vitality whenever Streisand is busy and the pixilated juveniles take over, but Kelly is determined to give his audience a showcase--a slam-bang, old-fashioned musical parade with pearls and feathers and floor-length gowns. At that, he succeeded. *** from ****\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 15 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 134 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

In this movie, the characters go to a bar, get into fights, and stripping is alluded to. However, that's not to say it isn't appropriate for children. I watched this movie when I was very young and I was so innocent that I didn't realize what those things meant. Now that I am older, I still enjoy the film. That's what makes it so great- it's enjoyable for both children and adults. Vincent Price is amazing in this film playing one of Disney's best villains. I don't know the other voice actors, but they were also great, especially the person playing Olivia. Her Scottish accent was spot-on and so darn cute. Strong characterization is one of the stronger points in this movie. Although Basil may appear cynical on the outside, he is really a sucker for Olivia. Dawson is charming and kind, Fidget is 10 times more hilarious than your average bumbling sidekick, and as I said already, Ratigan and Olivia are sublime. The Great Mouse Detective also has great music. It features 3 original songs, \"World's Greatest Criminal Mind\" and \"Goodbye So Soon\" performed by Vincent Price, and \"Let Me Be Good to You\" performed by Melissa Manchester as the white dancer mouse. I am proud to say that LMBGTY is one of my favorite songs of all time. Also, an excellent original score is prevalent in this movie- I wish I knew somewhere were I could get my hands on a soundtrack!! The animation is dark and moody- generally not what you'd expect from a Disney movie, and the Big Ben scene is impressive even 20 years later.I highly recommend this movie for all Disney fans, and even for non-Disney fans. Great Mouse Detective is a diamond in the rough!!\n\n\n\n\n                28 of 34 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 129 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is this movie based on a book?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n|\nGerman\n|\nItalian\n\n\nRelease Date: 4 July 1987 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Harpatkeotav Shel Super Balash\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

During the talent show auditions, they meet a big-time producer named Jackal Johnson, who tries to make the group into superstars, but the girls run into many problems. Galleria becomes a full-time snob and forgets her friends, Dorinda has to choose between her friends or the dance club and other things that could break the Cheetah Girls apart permanently.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n talent\n|\n cheetah girls\n|\n dance\n|\n audition\n|\n female protagonist\n|\u00a0See All (41)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThey have one shot to show their spots        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The song \"Cinderella\" is a cover of the song from Swedish girl group 'Play.'

It shows that these 4 girls (Galleria, Chanel, Aqua, and Dorinda) are working hard for their dreams.  It also shows what happens when you get too big of an ego- you lose your friends and your dreams, like when Galleria (played by Raven-Symone) took over the group and tried to run the business end of the deal.  In the end though, the girls worked out their differences and realized that they wanted to do things on their own and work hard instead of instant gratification.  Also I liked the fact that the girls did not dress inappropriately (something I am always concerned about when I watch a movie with my 8 year old daughter).\n\n\n\n\n                3 of 9 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 76 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Yes, this is not a filmed version of the stage play - GET OVER IT!  What we have is a funny, smart, classic film musical that gets virtually everything right. Dick Van Dyke reprises his Broadway role while at the peak of his career, Paul Lynde gives his best film performance, Maureen Stapleton milks her part for all it's worth, and Ann-Margret is simply astounding!  The only casting error is Janet Leigh - but they needed a name, since everyone else in the cast was unknown at the time.  While Leigh gives a solid performance, songs had to be cut since she could sing only with difficulty.  But this is a minor flaw - everything else about this film is spot on, as demonstrated by the sad effort to redo it for TV in 1995.  It captures the era perfectly - of course, it's dated: it's about America in the early 60s!  If it wasn't dated, it wouldn't work!  So if you haven't seen it, get it - I just watched in in NYC's Bryant Park with thousands of jaded New Yorkers, and it won over that audience completely.

The guy they got to mimic Jack Black is particularly pathetic, and there's not a single talented cast member to be found among all of the children. Shouldn't at least one cast member be funny or likable?The music is also incredibly pathetic. It's called \"School of ROCK\" yet it is full of muzak. Just terrible.And lay off the laugh track Nickelodeon, you're not fooling anyone into laughing at your awful shows. It's just so bloody annoying.One of only two shows I've ever forbidden people from watching in my home, and the only one nobody objected to since nobody wants to watch this dreck.\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 16 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 36 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

I don't recall any weaknesses other than the sound being poor in a few cases, and I wasn't able to hear dialogue.Apparently having an unknown as the lead is the best idea. it worked last year, and Maddie Baillio did a great job. She can sing and dance and has a nice personality.Harvey Fierstein makes an ideal drag queen. That voice!Martin Short is surprisingly good as Tracy's father. He is basically the same character Martin Short always plays, but he just stands out so much more than I expected.While I am kind of a square, most of this music isn't too bad compared to what passes for music in 2016. And there were even songs for someone with my particular taste.Jennifer Hudson does a great job. Her style of singing isn't really my taste, but that's not important. She steals the show when she sings. People will like her.Ariana Grande is so adorable as the shy best friend, but she really shows her singing and dancing talent later, and she looks good in a short skirt.What a hypocrite Kristin Chenoweth is! All this emphasis on high moral standards but she shows off her chest. Great job, and she even hits those really high notes.Dove Cameron does a nice job as the spoiled daughter who thinks she will be Miss Hairspray because of all the strings being pulled.Ephraim Sykes is quite appealing as Seaweed, the teen who is tired of being a second-class citizen and teaches Tracy the moves she needs to make it, and he really stands out.I'm sure I left someone out, but I can't think of anyone who didn't do a good job.I was surprised by the amount of time devoted to the quest for integration, but it's an important message here.NBC needs to keep doing these musicals.\n\n\n\n\n                5 of 14 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 24 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The island's main resource is a beautiful, expensive, blue silk produced by a silkworm unique to the island, but the island's textile industry and export is controlled by the paramilitary group and the islanders are forced to work for them every day of the week - the women at the textile factory, and the men at the shipping docks. One day, Deni, who works part time at the docks and part time as the local radio station's house musician whose passionate music is extremely popular among the islanders, decides to hold a secret concert in the evening to make everyone happy, if only for a day. However, the leader of Red Cargo, who also controls the textile industry and export, warns Deni not to do it or the islanders will be too tired to come to work the day after the concert and he ...\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n tropical island\n|\n musician assassinated\n|\n political assassination\n|\n musician\n|\n musical performance\n|\u00a0See All (46)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Thriller\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Premiered after Childish Gambino's April 12th, 2019 Coachella set on Amazon Prime        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nDuring the \"This is America\" scene, Deni Maroon is seen with a coworker at the docks.

Cursed as a child, Prince Philippe Charming compulsively proposes to every woman he encounters, leaving a trail of lovesick ladies and scorned lovers to wreak vengeful havoc on the Kingdom. Ultimately, Prince Philippe's exasperated father, King Charming, gives the young Prince an ultimatum... Find a true, true-love before his 21st Birthday or lose all claim to the throne.\nWritten by\n3QU Media \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n fairy godmother character\n|\n prince charming character\n|\n sleeping beauty character\n|\n snow white character\n|\n the beast character\n|\u00a0See All (17)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nSia and Experienced Voice Actress Tara Strong's 2nd Animated film together, after My Little Pony: The Movie (2017).

All of the cast performs very professionally, but still. The plot doesn't advance naturally, it doesn't flow it stumbles ahead very predictably, as we all knew it would, to the not surprising end. On the road it hits every cliche in the book, many of them are mentioned as if jokingly, but they move the plot forward despite of making us all aware the scriptwriters know it's a cliche.  So basically, as I stated in the title, the end result is simplistic and forced. Can't say it was painful to watch, but I did cringe in my chair more than once, and its just plain shame, cause I can see here potential for a better movie.\n\n\n\n\n                22 of 26 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 46 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

After viewing the film, Steven Spielberg agreed. Don also worked on both these films during his time working at the Disney Company.

A mouse! instead of \"Ahh it's a mouse!\" followed by 2 townspeople who ask \"What's going on?\"Jake and Tiger of the Mott Street Maulers are having a conversion right before the camera cuts into the scene with Fievel in a cage crying.The voices of the 2 bully mouse orphans were re-dubbed by different voice actors.The original music score in the end credits by James Horner has been cut off and jumps into the ending theme song \"Somewhere Out There\".At the end of the credits, 2 company logos called Deluxe Digital Studios, and CP Marcovision Quality Productions appears right before the DVD ends.

I always felt sad for Fievel when he was away from his parents, and at the time, I never knew that they were always very near him. I thought that they were always far away from him like he thought. Not too long ago, I bought this movie and watched it again...for the first time in years. I'm 17 and I still love the movie. It's the ultimate animated movie when it comes to being gentle, heart warming, and full of good heart. And the film is such a wonder to behold, even after all these years. Despite another sequel and one (or was that 2?) (one was made in 1999 and it's coming soon to video?) direct to video movies. Out of the three I've seen, this one is still the best, and it's among my favorite animated movies of all time\n\n\n\n\n                23 of 26 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 97 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Does anybody have a clue who played the voices of Warren T.

After being separated from his mother, Dumbo is relegated to the circus' clown acts; it is up to his only friend, a mouse, to assist Dumbo to achieve his full potential.\nWritten by\nTim Pickett <quetzal@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n circus\n|\n elephant\n|\n stork\n|\n mother son relationship\n|\n florida\n|\u00a0See All (208)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nD...is for DUMBO, the Baby Elephant Whose Over-Size Ears Always Get Him Into Trouble!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nG\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    This film was added to the U.

(The 1995 laserdisc release actually did retain the RKO titles before then.)

Mouse and some cunning crows, learns that he can fly. One of Disney's early animated features, the movie is less sumptuous and detailed than 'Snow White' (1937) or 'Fantasia' (1940), but is still a fine example of classic animation. Unique in a titular Disney 'hero', Dumbo never speaks, but the voice cast for the rest of the characters is excellent. The music is great, especially the clever \"When I See an Elephant Fly\", and the surreal \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence is outstanding. A timeless classic.\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 7 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 180 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'Dumbo' about?\n\n\nQ:\n Is 'Dumbo' based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 31 October 1941 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: \u0414\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043e\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nWalt Disney Feature Animation - 500 S.

Unfortunately, nothing worked out quite as it was supposed to - years later, Hedwig is leading her rock band on a tour of the U.S., telling her life story through a series of concerts at Bilgewater Inn seafood restaurants. Her tour dates coincide with those of arena-rock star Tommy Gnosis, a wide-eyed boy who once loved Hedwig - but then left with all her songs.\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n teenage boy\n|\n drag\n|\n handjob\n|\n band\n|\n rock band\n|\u00a0See All (80)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nAn anatomically incorrect rock odyssey        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated R for sexual content and language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Unlike most musical films, the film's musical segments are only partly filmed on playback. John Cameron Mitchell didn't want to have to lip-sync the lines in the music so the band playing was recorded in studio, played back on set and sang live. His vocals were recorded and then mixed later on with the recording of the band, making it sound like they too were performing live. However, on the soundtrack, the vocals were mixed to sound as if they were recorded in a studio as opposed to on set.

The second clearly shows it open by the curtain bowing towards the ground, and the third shows it closed once again.

It centres on Hedwig, whose only way of escaping from East Berlin is to undergo a sex-change and assume his mother's identity. Unfortunately the operation goes wrong and he is left with an `angry inch'. Escaping to America, he forms a rock band whilst seeking the soul partner that will fulfil his destiny. Loaded with songs that you will be humming all the way out of the cinema, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is the funniest, most outrageously entertaining movie of its kind since Rocky Horror. Unlike Rocky Horror, it does have some more serious philosophical reflections built into it (mostly via the songs), but it rocks, kicks ass and injects some seriously funny pizzaz into the transgender scene. I had the advantage not only of seeing the UK stage version a few days after the film, but also hearing the director speak about his work at the UK premiere. As a first time film effort it's quite an accomplishment, but as Cameron also played Hedwig in the stage version he had a starter for ten. On the down-side, the film is probably better on second or third viewing, when all the pieces would fit into place, and towards the end there is a tendency to tell the story only in songs and so at the expense of any serious script writing. But still it's a must-see movie.\n\n\n\n\n                31 of 34 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 241 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is the dialogue in German between young Hansel and his mother, when he's watching a cartoon?

The character needs to be BOLD and shocking and BOTH masculine AND feminine at the same time. Needs to be playful, violent, and sexual or the premise does not work. FnF needs to take command of the stage AND seduce everyone. In leather and fishnet stockings. The seduction is what MAKES the show.Where was the raw sex appeal? The boldness, the Master toying with a mouse? The line, \"Don't be upset by the way I look\" fell flat with a tentative FnF wearing a red sequined dress from Golden Girls.\n\n\n\n\n                24 of 29 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 230 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Who plays the assistant to the narrator (criminologist) I was unable to find her in the credits.\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 20 October 2016 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: The Rocky Horror Picture Show\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$20,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n The Jackal Group, Ode Visuals, Fox 21 Television Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n93 min\n            (DVD)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nStereo\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 HD\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Sure as I'm named Remus. And just cause these your tales about critters like Brer Rabbit and Brer Fox. That don't mean they ain't the same like can happen to folks. So then what can't learn from a tale about critters, just ain't got they ears tuned for listening. Like as not they too busy going along all mixed up with they own troubles.

As a person of color I was not offended by what was shown on the video. What next Turner bans Gone With The Wind? I'm more offended by Prissy than anything in this film. I was in London recently and found a used PAL copy for sale cheap. Lucky for me I work in the entertainment industry and had the ability to convert the film and sat down and watched it. What a sweet wonderful film I loved it. I've since been making copies (free) for all of my family and my neices and newphews have watched it every day. Ti hear them all singing Zippy Do Dah made it worth it. Now all my friends are begging for copies. So for the cost of the tape and time and wear and tear on my machines I've been making them copies. I feel like giving one to everyoine in the world. This movie should never have been banned!!!\n\n\n\n\n                115 of 127 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 276 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Chicago Opening Happened When?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 20 November 1946 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Canci\u00f3n del sur\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nPhoenix, Arizona, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $4,203,111,\n23 November 1986 \n\nGross USA: $37,459,346        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $37,459,346        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n94 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(RCA Sound System)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Seven years ago, Miss Wulla Jean died, leaving the Chicken Ranch to her favorite working girl, Miss Mona Stangley, who wants to keep the same traditions of Miss Wulla Jean. The Chicken Ranch has always had the unofficial blessing of the local authorities, who see the ranch providing an important community service, one which most in local authority have used at one time or another in their lives. In fact, Miss Mona and Lanville County Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd have been in a relationship for years, Ed Earl, who is Miss Mona's protector, albeit one with a hot temper and good ol' boy attitude that doesn't exactly match the needs of his law upholding position.

This refers to being disappointed or down. Filled candies were not as available in the 1930s through the 1950s, as they are today, and were expensive. Children usually got chocolate-covered filled candy at Christmas time as a treat. If their families were experiencing financial troubles, all they would get were the relatively cheap hard candies, which left them disappointed.

In more recent prints of the film, the credit has been removed.

Consigned to rubble, a rag-tag crew of South Bronx teenagers are nothings and nobodies with no one to shelter them - except each other, armed only with verbal games, improvised dance steps, some magic markers and spray cans. From Bronx tenements, to the SoHo art scene; from CBGBs to Studio 54 and even the glass towers of the just-built World Trade Center, The Get Down is a mythic saga of how New York at the brink of bankruptcy gave birth to hip-hop, punk and disco -- told through the lives and music of the South Bronx kids who changed the city, and the world...forever.\nWritten by\nNetflix \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n teenager\n|\n 1970s\n|\n new york city\n|\u00a0See All (3)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nRule the world.        \n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    A bunch of quotes and some cut in sequences is from the documentary about NYC Hiphop film called \"wild style\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nConnections\n        Referenced in WatchMojo: Top 10 Most Anticipated Netflix Originals of 2017\u00a0(2017)\n\n\n        See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Reviews\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClassy\n\n                        13 August 2016 | by iconians\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nI was not there then but I can appreciate it. At times, it feels slightly overplayed (the gang scenes in EP 1 for example), but otherwise it's well done. Music is exactly what you'd expect and the women are gorgeous. I also like the flashback elements. They were effective and not overly long or preachy, as flashbacks can get.Story is layered, starts off at several ends and slowly weaves together. I have really enjoyed it so far. The series also uses documentary to weave real life elements together as a political statement of the ghetto 70's NY. It's hard to imagine just how corrupted NYC was in the 70s. Just crazy\n\n\n\n\n                32 of 49 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 65 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Where can I find a song I heard during the show?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 12 August 2016 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: \u0412\u0456\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0432\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\n85 Court St, White Plains, New York, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$120,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Bazmark Films, Sony Pictures Television \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n52 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nStereo\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n|  Black and White\n\n\n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Writers and producers have such a refreshing and daring humour there, it's a joy to ignore American sitcoms for a while and take a peek at British comedy shows. \"The Mighty Boosh\" is another very original and imaginative show that grew from a stage act to a radio show to a T.V. sitcom. Every episode is taking place in different locations including jungles, deserted islands, snow and sandy deserts and underwater worlds. Sounds far out? It is.The only things linking up from one episode to the next are the main characters, clumsy, but lovable Howard Moon (Julian Barratt) and Uber-Mod Vince Noir (Noel Fielding). In the first series these two are working at a zoo where some rather curious colleagues of theirs hang out, too. The second series mainly takes place at night. Vince and Howard have moved in with their friend Naboo, an Indian shaman, and a talking ape. Sounds far out? It is.Another element that's in every episode is the hilarious, quite catchy music. Barratt is responsible for these short little ear candies. As funny as these songs may be they reveal a real songwriting talent as Barratt covers a lot of different styles effortlessly. Usually I'm not a big fan of musical parts in TV shows, but it works here and the songs about \"Nanageddon\", \"Mod Wolves\" and the \"Ape Of Death\" make this program even more special. Sounds far out? It is.The humour of \"The Boosh\" is not as in your face as in other sitcoms. The show is more amusing than it is flat out hilarious. That and the innocent, child-like creativity of \"The Boosh\" might not be for everyone and these are probably the reasons for the show being more of a cult phenomenon right now. Barratt and Fielding already have a loyal following, though, and I'm sure that it will grow over time. Very English, very far out.

As children and adolescents, Derek and Odette can't stand each other, but as young adults they begin to see each other in a different light and fall in love with each other. But one night things take a bad turn when Derek unintentionally offends Odette, who then refuses to marry him if he can't prove that he loves her for who she is and not just her beauty. Odette and her father are then attacked by Lord Rothbart, a vengeful sorcerer who was cast out of William's kingdom when he plotted against the king. In the form of a beast, Rothbart mortally wounds William, and kidnaps Odette then places her under a spell. Now it is up to Derek to rescue Odette by showing his undying love. But will he be in time?\nWritten by\nAnthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com} \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n princess\n|\n sorcerer\n|\n prince\n|\n king\n|\n vow\n|\u00a0See All (55)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Magic Begins November 1994                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Michelle Nicastro was originally going to do the singing voice of Odette as well; however, the producers felt that her voice was not graceful enough for Odette. So Liz Callaway provided the singing voice instead. Nicastro would do the singing voice for Odette in the sequels later on.

In the next scene, when he is kissing Uberta, his cloak changes to blue. Then it is green again. Although none of the characters change clothing throughout the first scenes in the movie, William's cloak changes color frequently throughout his scenes.

Kings and queens came from all around to offer the gifts to the child. Among them was the widow Uberta and her young son Prince Derek...

Just when they seem to do just that, Derek says \"You're beautiful.\", and Odette ask \"What else?\". Derek could only reply \"What else is there?\". Evil sorcerer Lord Rothbart kidnaps Odette and places her under a spell which turns her into a swan. She turns back to a woman when she's on the lake as the moon rise. When moonlight leaves the lake, she's turn back into a swan. The only way to break the spell is to have her love make a vow of everlasting love.This is very much an 80s style animation with the singing, the drawing, and the subject matter. All the characters are straight out of 80s Disney movies. And quite frankly, it works on that terms. The animation, the jokes, the princess subject, the songs... all of it works but only on that term.\n\n\n\n\n                4 of 7 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 69 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Odette's mother is never mentioned.

If you watch unbiased, I think you will find it has a little something for everyone.  The film has beautiful direction, wonderful performances, lovely music, some sly humor, and is truly inspirational. Barbra Streisand had wanted to make this film since 1968, but everyone in the industry told her she was crazy.  In 1979, she was still determined to make the film, even if the studio's weren't.  She was turned down by every motion picture company at least twice, until finally in the early eighties, MGM/UA picked up the project.  Made on a then-above average budget of about $14 million, YENTL was released to mostly positive reviews and eventually grossed a surprisingly strong $50 million in the US alone and did twice as well around the world.  The only disappointment is that Streisand was snubbed by Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n                26 of 46 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 97 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n Is 'Yentl' based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n How old is Yentl supposed to be?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUK\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nHebrew\n\n\nRelease Date: 5 April 1984 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: \u0419\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043b\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nBlewbury, Oxfordshire, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$12,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nGross USA: $40,218,899        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $40,218,899        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Ladbroke, Barwood Films, United Artists \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n133 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n| 4-Track Stereo\n(Dolby Magnetic 35mm prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Jerry in turn falls for Lise, a young French girl already engaged to a cabaret singer. Jerry jokes, sings and dances with his best friend, an acerbic would-be concert pianist, while romantic complications abound.\nWritten by\nScott Renshaw <as.idc@forsythe.stanford.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n painter\n|\n singer\n|\n post world war two\n|\n dancer\n|\n fantasy sequence\n|\u00a0See All (109)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nWhat a joy to see M-G-M's Technicolor musical!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    When this film won the Oscar for Best Picture, M-G-M was surprised. As a result, the studio took out a full page ad in the trade paper Variety with their mascot Leo the Lion looking chagrined and sheepishly admitting: \"Honestly, I was just sitting in the sun, waiting for a streetcar,\" a reference to likelier Best Picture winners A Place in the Sun (1951) and A Streetcar Named Desire (1951).

It was lighthearted, delightful, and very colorful. You can see that MGM was showing off Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film. Every scene is packed full. The choreography was great. Gene Kelly is a wonder. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed, and perfectly designed. He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else. The last section of the film, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. What makes this film very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers have had a better gift for melody. I very much enjoy Gershwin's music. It is enchanting. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. He is so witty and charming. This was a highly entertaining film.\n\n\n\n\n                25 of 39 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 175 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Are there any other movies with long periods of dialogue-free action?\n\n\nQ:\n What make was Milo's green convertible?\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n|\nGerman\n\n\nRelease Date: 11 November 1951 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ein Amerikaner in Paris\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios - 10202 W.

Once again hitting the road to re-unite the band and win the big prize at the New Orleans Battle of the Bands, Elwood is pursued cross-country by the cops, led by Cabel the Curtis' son (and Elwood's step-brother), the Russian Mafia, and a militia group. On his new \"mission from God\" Elwood enlists the help of a young orphan, and a strip club bartender.\nWritten by\nStephen Scaia <s_scaia@emerson.edu> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n music band\n|\n car chase\n|\n release from prison\n|\n blues music\n|\n sequel with unusual number\n|\u00a0See All (67)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Blues Are Back        \n\n\nGenres:\n Action\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Crime\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG-13 for exotic dancing and some language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nWally High's last film.

It was cool that they tied in the deaths of John Belushi and Cab Calloway into the movie's plot, making the characters they played dead as well.  If Jim Belushi took the part of Joliet Jake, that would have been a disaster. Still, the plot of this movie could have used some serious work. For instance, in the original movie, the Blues Brothers (a) were actually brothers and (b) were on an actual \"mission from God\".  Their goal was to make some honest money to save an orphanage from shutting down, while trying to flee from the police at the same time.  The movie brought back blues legends such as Aretha Franklin and James Brown back into the spotlight, and it helped contribute to the death of disco. Eighteen years later, Jake's dead, Cab Calloway's dead, the orphanage has been shut down, so why are they being chased by the police?  Because a half brother of Elwood got p***ed off at finding his real past? The kid, I must add, was a nice touch, and it was cool to see twice as many blues legends in this movie, including some new artists like Johnny Lang and Erykah Badu.  But there should have been a better plot, because it seemed as though the Blues Brothers Band were going from event to event for the hell of it.  Where's the plot in that?  Police, leave these guys alone. The big mistake in this movie was its attempt to outdo the original movie. The music was great, and I highly recommend buying the soundtrack. However, don't expect to see a plot in this story.  Otherwise, enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n                29 of 55 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 228 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Are there plans for a sequel?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nRussian\n\n\nRelease Date: 5 June 1998 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Blues Brothers - Il mito continua\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nPalatine, Illinois, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$28,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $6,129,615,\n8 February 1998 \n\nGross USA: $14,051,384        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $14,051,384        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Universal Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n123 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDTS\n| DTS-Stereo\n| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When June marries and leaves, Rose turns her hope and attention to her elder, less obviously talented, daughter Louise. However, having her headlining as a stripper at Minsky's Burlesque is not what she initially has in mind.\nWritten by\nJeremy Perkins {J-26} \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n 1920s\n|\n burlesque\n|\n stripper\n|\n show business\n|\n 1930s\n|\u00a0See All (50)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Magnificent Musical Where \"Everything's Coming Up Roses.\"                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Biography\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\nApproved\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nRose Marie was considered to dub the vocals for Rose.

See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nThe song \"Together, Wherever We Go\", along with the second duet part of \"You'll Never Get Away from Me\" was cut after the film was first released and was, for the most part, forgotten (both songs feature Karl Malden). it was supposed that all prints of these songs had disinigrated (the video version even says that they are no longer available). Recently, a film collector was found who had an old print of Gypsy with these songs intact but in very poor condition. They are included on the dvd in the \"bonus\" section.

My biggest disappointment comes from the foolish excising of \"Together\" from the film.Even though the \"lost\" footage is added as an extra after the film on the DVD and Video, there is a verse missing. I was told that there are no more 35 mm prints in existence of this film but, I do not have statistics or proof to back this up but, I am sure there must be a copy of this film with the entire song in tact and Karl Malden's Verse in \"You'll Never Get Away From Me.\" I have no clear reason as to why \"Together...\" was cut and I would like to know why but, I am in hopes it can be found somewhere and added in another video release undamaged.-Tony\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 7 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 88 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n Is 'Gypsy' based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n Does Natalie Wood do her own singing?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 1 November 1962 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Gypsy - K\u00f6nigin der Nacht\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nStage 19, Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$4,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Mervyn LeRoy Productions Inc. \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n143 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\n6-Track Stereo\n(70 mm prints)| 4-Track Stereo\n(RCA Sound Recording)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In this musical comedy television adventure, Galavant is assisted by Princess Isabella (Karen David), and Sid (Luke Youngblood), his squire. Meanwhile, King Richard tries to win over the affections of his captured love, Madalena. The show follows Galavant's journeys through medieval times creating countless hilarious twist and turns plus a wealth of original new musical numbers.\n\n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n hero\n|\n knight\n|\n royalty\n|\n castle\n|\n middle ages\n|\u00a0See All (9)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe New Sunday Knight                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    ABC got an enormous tax break by shooting in the U.K., which made the lavish production cheaper to produce than their single-camera half-hour comedies that were shot in the U.S.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nConnections\n        Referenced in Psych 2: Lassie Come Home\u00a0(2020)\n\n\n        See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Reviews\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGood light-hearted fun\n\n                        5 January 2015 | by walkindude_2000\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nShows like Galavant are an acquired taste. This show will never win any awards, and I think they are wise to go with a four week limited run--it would never survive as an on-going series. But it is FUN. All the actors take their roles right to the point of chewing scenery, then leave it there. The songs are light, and the sexual overtones are just enough to make you laugh without covering your kids' ears. You may not want to go out of your way to watch this show when it is on, but DVR it and watch it sometime. If you like Monty Python or Family Guy, you will probably enjoy this show enough to give it a try. If you don't like it after the first two episodes, it is only an hour of your time. And oh, if you use the DVR, don't fast forward through the commercials!\n\n\n\n\n                54 of 69 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 100 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

In this particular movie, a Police Officer, who's family was killed by a bandit named Gabbar Singh, decides to fight fire with fire and recruits two convicts, Jai and Veeru to capture Gabbar. He approaches them in jail, puts the proposal in front of them, and they agree to bring in Gabbar Singh alive - for a hefty price. After their discharge from jail, they travel by train to the village where the Police Officer lives - now with only his widowed daughter-in-law. The three band together to fight one of the most elusive and dreaded bandits of all time. Will the two ex-cons be able to bring Gabbar alive to the Police Officer?\nWritten by\nCalista \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n bandit gang\n|\n bounty hunter\n|\n friendship between men\n|\n widow\n|\n villain\n|\u00a0See All (92)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe greatest star cast ever assembled.......The greatest story ever told        \n\n\nGenres:\n Action\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Thriller\u00a0|\n Western\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Was about to be removed from cinemas because of low attendance figures, but attendance started rising and word-of-mouth made it Indian cinema's biggest hit (until Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995)) with some theaters playing the film for several years.

It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest \"curry\" westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the \"spaghetti\" westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after.

Kitty catches Nick in an indiscretion when she finds a love poem, extolling the virtues of one specific body part, Nick wrote to his mistress, Tula. The poem is the last straw for Kitty regarding their marriage. Kitty has the support of their three grown daughters - biological or other - her cousin Bo, her pastor and others at the church. They help her with among other things finding and thus dealing with Tula, who she does not know, and looking back at if she made a mistake in choosing Nick over her first love. On the other side, Nick turns to his co-worker Angelo, and a local police officer/ex-military man for advice, which he also gets unsolicited from his tough talking mother. Nick still has Tula, a frank-talking Northern English sex shop clerk, who truly loves Nick's body parts as he loves hers. A little emotional distance may provide Nick and Kitty the best perspective of what their future holds.\nWritten by\nHuggo \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n anal sex\n|\n pretty legs\n|\n sex\n|\n dream\n|\n redemption\n|\u00a0See All (161)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA Savage Musical        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated R for sexual content including some strong dialogue, and language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Writer-director John Turturro chose the songs featured in this film before he had secured their rights. While waiting for Gandolfini to be free from shooting The Sopranos (1999), the director went around to secure these rights from their songwriters and singers.

When he shuts the front door, the music volume does not change. It should become more muffled with the door shut.

To rich, tan, bored housewives who take the fat from the ass cheeks and inject it into their lips. You gonna kiss someone's ass then you should know that that's what you're kissing. Personally, I think that kissing's sexier than shagging, but you're sucking on chicken fat there. Not that their husbands mind.

This movie set the world record for most wasted talent and you cannot blame anyone but John Turturo since he both wrote and directed it. I would explain the plot but I have no idea what the plot was or the point of the whole exercise. I will say this, there is some good music in the film from James Brown, Harvey and the Moonglows, Janis Joplin and Dusty Springfield so there are a few enjoyable moments, but if that does not interest you do not waste your time. It is very likely that you will look at the cast and say to yourself \"I really like so and so, I think I'll take a chance.\" Don't do it.\n\n\n\n\n                2 of 2 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 79 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Then when he puts the latch back on, the handle is below the beam.

Like most small boys, Christopher Robin has toy animals to play with, and they all live together in a wonderful world of make-believe. But his best friend is a bear called Winnie the Pooh, or Pooh, for short. Now, Pooh had some very unusual adventures, and they all happened right here in the Hundred-Acre Wood.\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    A live action Winnie The Pooh teddy bear winks at the audience at the very end of the film.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nThe version played on the Disney channel has an alternate final third than the theatrical version. In the Disney channel version, the \"Tigger too\" and \"we say goodbye\" segments are deleted, and they are replaced with the fourth \"Winnie the Pooh\" short, which wasnt previously included, \"A day for Eeyore\".  This means it abruptly goes from Piglet saying \"and Piglet too!\" at the end of the \"Blustery Day\" segment, to the begining of \"A day for Eeyore\", and the film ends with that short. Previously, the scene continued, and Pooh introduced \"Tigger too\", which was followed by the \"we say goodbye\" sequence\", and then the film ends.

This is my favorite of all the Pooh movies. My favorite story is the first one, Winnie The Pooh and the Honey Tree, where Pooh eats too much honey and gets stuck in Rabbit's hole.  It is such a heartwarming movie.  I love most of the Disney movies that I saw, but this has to be one of my all time faves.  My son, who is now 14 months old, is an absolute Winnie the Pooh nut.  He goes nuts when the opening comes on (even though only Pooh's right arm and leg are seen).  His favorite is also The Honey Tree story.  Unfortunately, I dread the very last story, because he cries because the movie is over, and that means the end of the movie.  He watches it so much, I have to have a second copy!  If you have children, or even if you don't and you just plain love Disney (like me and my son), I highly recommend Pooh.  It will really cheer you up when you are feeling bad, so I really recommend this movie (you won't be sorry you bought it!).\n\n\n\n\n                21 of 22 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 62 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The Monty Python team is trying to sort out the most important question on Earth: what is the meaning of life? They do so by exploring the various stages of life, starting with birth. A doctor seems more interested in his equipment than in delivering the baby or caring for the mother, a Roman Catholic couple have quite a lot of children because \"every sperm is sacred\". In the growing and learning part of life, Catholic schoolboys attend a rather strange church service and ditto sex education lesson. Onto war, where an officer's plan to attack is thwarted by his underlings wanting to celebrate his birthday, and an officer's leg is bitten off by presumably an African tiger. At middle age, a couple orders \"philosophy\" at a restaurant, after which, the movie continues with live organ transplants. The autumn years are played in a restaurant, which, after being treated to the song \"Isn't It Awfully Nice to Have a Penis?\" by an entertainer, sees the ...\nWritten by\nArnoud Tiele (imdb@tiele.nl) \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n death\n|\n greed\n|\n philosophy\n|\n monty python\n|\n meaning of life\n|\u00a0See All (116)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nIt took God six days to create the earth, and Monty Python just 90 minutes to screw it up.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    For \"The Crimson Permanent Assurance\" segment, the real building used for the location shoot was Lloyd's Register of Shipping headquarters in London, on the corner of Fenchurch Street and Lloyd's Avenue.

Both are in a low male voice. The first one says \"There will be a short film of approximately ten minutes before our feature presentation\" (even though the short film is about 16 minutes), and the second one, over a short organ fanfare, says \"And now, our feature presentation.\" Later versions leave these completely silent.

Even I find some of the sketches too vulgar and a few to be repulsive but that's Monty Pythn for you: sometimes stupid, sometimes outrageous and sometimes funny. The sketch that I enjoyed most was the one with the old office workers fighting with the corperates of modern day. I was also morbidly fascinated by the organ donor sketch. The team: Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and others do a good job of acting, writing and directing. Yes, it might not be everyone's cup of tea but those familiar with the Monty Python series know what kind of humour to expect. I enjoyed lots of it but the one with the fat guy at the restaurant was disgusting to watch. On a final note, the special features on the DVD are worth viewing.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 12 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 225 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why did the Maitre d' intentionally blow up Mr Creosote at [1:23:50]?\n\n\nQ:\n What are the differences between the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 7 July 1983 (UK)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Der Sinn des Lebens\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nCartwright Hall, Lister Park, North Park Road, Manningham, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$9,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $1,987,853,\n3 April 1983 \n\nGross USA: $14,929,552        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $14,949,697        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Celandine Films, The Monty Python Partnership, Universal Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n107 min\n|\n112 min\n            (2003 restored director's cut)\n          |\n90 min\n            (original)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Stereo\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Chewie and Han Solo are trying to get to the planet where Chewie's family is waiting for him, but the Empire is out searching for the rebels, giving everyone a hard time. While we are waiting, we get a look at the everyday life of a Wookiee family. We meet all the familiar characters from Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) and we are introduced to Boba Fett during a short cartoon. We also pay a visit to the Cantina and meet all the monsters again.\nWritten by\nKynde \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n wilhelm scream\n|\n campy\n|\n virtual reality\n|\n tree house\n|\n drag\n|\u00a0See All (55)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nLuke Skywalker and Han Solo battle evil Imperial forces to help Chewbacca reach his imperiled family on the Wookiee planet - in time for Life Day, their most important day of the year!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Sci-Fi\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    According to Carrie Fisher, George Lucas gave her a copy of the special as a gift for recording the DVD commentary for Star Wars (1977).

I didn't even know one existed and I had actually seen both Ewok movies, go figure.Well as a joke I suppose our friend gave us the movie last night for xmas and we popped it in. It is by far the most heinous piece of crap I have ever seen. I was warned it was bad but, WOW it was terrible. I lost an hour and a half of my life and really nothing happened during that time other than losing any shred of respect I may have had for George Lucas.The effects are so bad they are hilarious and there seems to be some type of odd porn scene involving Chewbaca's father and some 70's Disco Queen. I watched most of the program with my mouth hanging wide open in utter disbelief. The rest of the time I was laughing at just how awful the whole thing really is.I still recommend watching the film if only to say that you have. Especially if you claim to be a Star Wars geek. Just make sure you have plenty of alcohol on hand and some friends with an excellent sense of humor.\n\n\n\n\n                74 of 86 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 304 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Why on Earth did George Lucas make this?\n\n\nQ:\n Are the events depicted in this program canon?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official Site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 17 November 1978 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Au temps de la guerre des \u00e9toiles\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nStage 2, The Burbank Studios, Burbank, California, USA\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$1,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Smith-Hemion Productions, 20th Century Fox Television, Lucasfilm \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n97 min\n|\n120 min\n|\n78 min\n            (re-cut)\n          |\n79 min\n            (cut)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

He gets the cash easily enough but mislays it when the pretty swimming pool manageress takes his mind off things. It seems he will lose both race and girl, problems made more difficult by rivalry from Elmo Mancini, fellow racer and womaniser. Perhaps some singing will help.\nWritten by\nJeremy Perkins {J-26} \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n las vegas nevada\n|\n psychotronic film\n|\n drag race\n|\n racecar driver\n|\n racecar\n|\u00a0See All (83)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nElvis is at the wheel but Ann-Margret drives him wild!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In the wake of this film's success, both Elvis and Ann-Margaret would regularly appear as headliners in various Las Vegas venues, and were always among the biggest draws whenever they performed there.

The camera starts from above and does remarkable movement (before the age of computer controlled cameras) and Ann-Margaret does all the choreography (including catching the toast and making sandwiches) to the beat all in one shot!  Possibly the best single-camera sequence of all time!The movie only really slows down during the obligatory tourist travelog while in the helicopter scene.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 10 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 96 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Is is true Ann-Margret upstaged the King?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            HBOMAX\n    \n|\n\n            Official site\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 20 May 1964 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Love in Las Vegas\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios - 10202 W.

Children would love this reboot and I would recommend it to anyone who has children.I also liked the Easter eggs of Steve and Joe in the first episodeThe only thing I wish is that they would have showed the first episodes of Blue's Clues with Steve and Joe earlier so children new to Blue's Clues in general get a better sense of who they are.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 11 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 22 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

This film is no exception. The story is okay, but the characters are boring, and you learn to hate Melody after a few really, really stupid moves on her part.It's not as bad as The Return of the Jafar, but not close to as good as The Lion King II: Simba's Pride or Aladdin and the King of Thieves or even Pocahontas II. Of course, none of these compare to the quality of Toy Story 2, which notably went to theaters and is actually better than the first one.You can really afford to miss this film.\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 16 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 89 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The unlikely courtship of Mr Darcy and (in our movie) a beautiful Indian girl starts with mutual contempt, but moves forward as they become wiser and learn that their first instincts, based on pride, prejudice and illusions, were wrong.The scene moves between Amritsar and Goa to London and Beverley Hills, all in brighter-than-bright super-saturated colour, with an assortment of equally colourful characters, wonderful costumes, lavish dance pieces and heavenly bollywood-style ballads. While almost everything is in English (except for a few subtitled songs), nearly all the characters are top Indian performers.In the golden age of musicals, stars such as Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire had a whole sub-industry to draw on for good dancers who could also sing and act well, plus the technicians used to producing high-end musicals. As demand waned, so did supply, and the West is now hard pressed to produce song and dance films that don't rely on snappy editing to suggest good dancing from top actors, or heavy coaching to suggest top dancers can act. Bollywood, on the other hand, has no such shortage, and Bride and Prejudice is the sumptuously choreographed musical with Indian dancing that has become nigh impossible with western dancers.Admittedly it's a bit cheesy at times - but it's self-consciously so, and as endearing as warm, gushy Indian hospitality. The sets and dialogue give authentic, if stereotypical, glimpses of Indian life and values. Like many east-meets-west movies, the stereotypes are a handle to allow easy assimilation of foreign ideas, and the heavy Indian involvement wards off any tendency to patronise (which is one of the themes explored in the film).This is not high drama or high art, but it's an accomplished romantic comedy / song-and-dance film, and one that warms the heart and makes you want to wave your arms in the air Indian-dance-style for the sheer joy and exuberance of happy endings.\n\n\n\n\n                103 of 122 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 290 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

When Susan and her bashful suitor find romance daunting, she joins the Harvey Girls instead. The saloon across the street with its alluring worldly-wise women offers them tough competition, fair and foul, and Susan catches the eye of the Ned Trent (John Hodiak), the distant but intense proprietor of the bar.\nWritten by\nMichael Meigs <Michael.Meigs@dos.us-state.gov> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n saloon\n|\n mail order bride\n|\n atchison topeka and santa fe railway\n|\n camp\n|\n restaurant\n|\u00a0See All (48)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nIt's Blazing, Blistering Romance . . . in the wide open spaces !                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Western\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    After a few years of stardom after The Wizard of Oz, Judy Garland began to have problems showing up for work or being late. During the making of Meet Me in St. Louis, she was late showing up for the Christmas ball scene keeping many background extras, cast, and crew waiting for hours. During the making of The Harvey Girls, it was reported in the book The World of Entertainment Hollywood's Greatest Musicals: the Freed Unit at MGM by Hugh Fordin that Judy was absent several days from Feb 9th 1945 through May 26th 1945. This was NOT the first movie where Judy Garland started showing up late for work or not showing up at all.

The plot though is cardboard especially in the second half and John Hodiak for my liking gives a rather lacklustre performance. Still it is worth seeing. The film with its beautiful costumes, scenery and photography does look gorgeous, the music is fantastic particularly the climatic set-piece On the Atchison, Topeka and The Santa Fe, the choreography is magnificent and the first half is great fun. The film is directed lovingly by George Sidney, and while Angela Lansbury and Ray Bolger are excellent, this is Judy Garland's film and she is absolutely wonderful. Overall, a lovely film. 8/10 Bethany Cox\n\n\n\n\n                4 of 4 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 59 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Training Montage (The Train Must Be Fed) lyrics\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 29 April 1946 (UK)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Las chicas de Harvey\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMonument Valley, Arizona, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$2,524,315\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n102 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(Western Electric Sound System)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical depicting the infamous real-life story of Eva \"Evita\" Duarte de Peron, the wife of President Juan Peron, who rose from poverty to become the most famous Argentine woman in history. Her huge political influence and constant charity works earned her scorn and fear from the military and upper classes but adoration and love from the workers and descamisados. Evita's legendary life is displayed before your eyes as the most hated and most beloved woman in Argentina.\nWritten by\nO.G. \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n argentina\n|\n argentine president\n|\n actress\n|\n politics\n|\n military\n|\u00a0See All (237)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Most Anticipated Motion Picture Event of The Year        \n\n\nGenres:\n Biography\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n History\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for thematic elements, images of violence and some mild language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nAntonio Banderas only speaks 6 words of dialog in the entire film.

Being used to watching flashy, colourful musicals, namely from MGM, full of catchy tunes and full of breathtaking dance routines, \"Evita\" left me quite shocked.  It was the first (and last) \"political\" musical I saw.  The music impressed me at once, however the story and the setting did not quite do so at first sight.  It was only later, when I read something about the life story of Eva Peron did I really appreciate the excellent work Lloyd Webber and Rice did.  Even though they were not 100% faithful to the real story, the bio-musical gave a somewhat clear picture of what type of woman Eva Peron was.  The movie was great with its re-enactments of the 1940s-1950s Argentine elections, however, having personally performed in the stage version (playing a descamisado, a waiter, a policeman and one of Eva's lovers), I cannot but point out the several drawbacks it had.  It is true that the funeral, the electoral campaign and the terrorism were by far better on screen than on stage, yet the stage musical had a certain charm which was lost in the film. It could be due to the fact that on stage there was some dancing involved while the movie had none; it could be because one was live and one was playback; it could be because some of the harmonies were lost in the movie; it could be simply due to the fact that in one I participated while in the other I was just a spectator.  I don't know, still the stage version was more \"alive\".  Nonetheless, in order to be fair, I have to admit that the movie version did have some improvements as regards to the play.  The best one of them was the song \"You Must Love Me\". Apart from finally re-uniting composer and lyricist after more than 10 years of cold war, it presents the First Lady of Argentina as a woman who has some feelings, who is afraid in front of her approaching death, who is not only interested in becoming vice-president, as the stage production tends to hint. How much this is historically true is beyond me, yet it is good to give some human element to the heroine.I was quite impressed by the actors' interpretations.  Madonna has finally showed the world that she is able to look great without taking her clothes off, that she is more than just voice, boobs and scandal.  Jonathan Pryce was excellent as the Argentine president - such a pity he had so little to sing, having such a great voice.  Antonio Banderas impressed me - I did not know he was that good at singing.  The role of the narrator was quite a breakthrough after his \u0091tough-guy' parts, and he did it quite well.  Some critics said that this movie would set the way for future film versions of musicals - I hope they were right!\n\n\n\n\n                30 of 48 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 212 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

In the Todd-AO version, the titles appear against a black background; then, the black background fades out to reveal two rows of giant cornstalks, through which the camera tracks, until it finds Gordon MacRae singing \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin\". In the CinemaScope version, we first see the cornstalks, the camera tracks through them; then, as the words \"Rodgers and Hammerstein present\" appear on-screen, Gordon MacRae appears and rides up to the camera and then past it off left, as the title \"Oklahoma!\" appears. The rest of the opening credits in this version are shown against, first, a background of a barn, then, a meadow with a tree nearby. As the credits end, the camera cuts back to MacRae and he begins singing. At the end of the Todd-AO version, we see the words \"A Magna Release\". At the end of the CinemaScope version, we see the words \"A Magna Production - Distributed by RKO Radio Pictures\".

Perfect singer-actors. Tantalizing cinematography. It does not seem to get much better than this.The main thing I admire about Oklahoma is that like the Rodgers and Hammerstein adaptations that would follow it (Carousel, South Pacific, Flower Drum Song, and, of course, The Sound of Music), the movie was fronted by legitimate musical talent, unlike in My Fair Lady and West Side Story. Further, it was a movie that did not rely on major stars, Rod Steiger notwithstanding, to make it an enjoyable picture. (Lest you forget this movie 'introduced' Shirley Jones as Laurey.  Lest you would also like to know, the stage musical Oklahoma debuted on March 31, 1943, which coincidentally was a birthday of Miss Jones (I won't say which one). Prophetic?  Maybe.\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 19 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 112 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

A con man currently going by the assumed name Harold Hill has used several different schemes to bilk the unsuspecting, and now travels from town to town pretending to be a professor of music - from Gary (Indiana) Conservatory of Music, class of '05 - who solves all the respective towns' youth problems by forming boys' marching bands. He takes money from the townsfolk to buy instruments, music, instructional materials, and uniforms for their sons. However, in reality he has no degree and knows nothing about music, and after all the materials arrive and are distributed, he absconds with all the money, never to be seen again. Many of the traveling salesmen in the territory have been negatively impacted by him, as the townsfolk then become suspicious of any stranger trying to sell them something. For Harold's scheme to work, he must gain the trust of the local music teacher, usually by wooing her, regardless of her appearance.

When I saw it long ago on TV, I was struck by how unusual it was but kept noticing certain distracting bits around the edge of the screen--it was the fade-outs and split-screen effects I was missing! Watch this film in letterboxed form ONLY please--it's visually, musically and dramatically innovative.Its splendors have already been mentioned. I add two minor treats: 1) appearance of lanky character actor Hank Worden (of \"The Searchers\" and \"Twin Peaks\") as the undertaker, and 2) script so full of bizarre slang and expressions, it's as if P.G. Wodehouse or Damon Runyan were writing turn-of-the-century Americana. My two carps are minor: I would have told Morton Da Costa to lose all the heavy-handed cutaways to the train wheels (\"Rock Island\") and chickens (\"Pick a Little, Talk a Little\") because we already got the point, and Ron Howard's cute lithp is a turn-off for me, but I never like cute kids. However, he's good at the climax, and when Shirley Jones hears him singing \"Wells Fargo Wagon\" and tears the evidence against Harold Hill out of the book (a librarian!), it's one of the most convincing turnarounds in musical history. Especially because she's still not fooled by the hucksterism, she just perceives it differently in comparison with the easily manipulated small-towners around her. She realizes that he's selling hope and joy despite himself (\"There's always a band.\") And when she just thanks him for his gift (\"Till There Was You\") and doesn't mind if he flees, of course he realizes he would be insane to leave. Another heartfelt turnaround.One of the most graceful musicals, marked by blurring of the line between straight dialogue and songs--as the line \"there was love all around but I never heard it singing\" implies, you can hear the singing if you listen for it in the world. It's in the trains and the chickens and the bands you hear in your head and the pride in your children playing that clarinet by the \"think system.\" Moving.\n\n\n\n\n                12 of 13 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 147 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'The Music Man' about?\n\n\nQ:\n Is 'The Music Man' based on a book?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 19 June 1962 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Meredith Willson's the Music Man\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nKings Row, Warner Brothers Burbank Studios - 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$4,240,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Warner Bros. \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n151 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\n4-Track Stereo\n(RCA Sound Recording)| DTS\n| SDDS\n| Dolby\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The film follows the stories of Davy and Ally, who have to re-learn how to live life in Edinburgh after coming home from serving in Afghanistan. Both struggle to learn to live a life outside the army and to deal with the everyday struggles of family, jobs and relationships.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n military service\n|\n afghanistan\n|\n edinburgh\n|\n scotland\n|\u00a0See All (4)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nWhen it happens... there's nothing like it!        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some suggestive and thematic material, language and brief violence\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nDexter Fletcher: Drunk.

The order is Peter Mullan, Jane Horrocks, George Mackay, Antonia Thomas, Freya Mavor, Kevin Guthrie, Jason Flemyng, Paul Brannigan, Sara Vickers, Michael Beat (as Michael 'Cuban' Keat) and John Spence (as 'Wee' John Spence').

I'm not quite sure why I should enjoy watching people sing their conversations instead of having a straightforward, impassioned talk. Sunshine on Leith isn't that kind of musical.Sunshine on Leith is cheesy, predictable and I had a fab time watching it! Adapted for the big screen, from his own stage play, by Stephen Greenhorn, Sunshine on Leith will be known by many as the Scottish comedy rammed to the gills with The Proclaimers' songs. The twins even enjoy a brief stroll in front of the camera and I found myself having a private game of Which Proclaimers' song comes next? in the cinema.Three soldiers return home to Scotland after a tour of duty and try to adapt to life on civvy street. While Davy (George Mackay) goes home to mum, Jean (Jane Horricks), dad, Rab (Peter Mullan), and sister, Liz (Freya Mavor), his best friend Ally (Kevin Guthrie), who is dating Liz, stays with his sister's family. On a celebratory night out, Davy hooks up with his sister's friend, Yvonne (Antonia Thomas) and over the next few months we watch as three relationships (Jean & Rab, Ally & Liz and Davy & Yvonne) evolve and deal with the challenges life throws at them.I'll be honest (as always), Sunshine on Leith is not a great film. There are occasional moments of ropey acting, it is difficult not to grimace at some of the circumstances, it all flows and finishes entirely too easily, there are far too many avenues hinted at but never explored, I'm pretty sure it's not a fair representation of Scotland and it's far from being an accurate portrayal of squaddies returning from warzones.In terms of feel good films, it's out of step with the likes of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and lacks the gritty charm of Ken Loach's little seen but superb The Angels' Share. There is an entire subplot starring the latter's Paul Brannigan as Ronnie, the third of the trio of soldiers, that is hinted at but not fully explored, as if time was of the essence and director Dexter Fletcher felt the need to excise him for pace, and it leaves us wondering why he was left in the film at all.But, gripes aside, this is an entertaining, inoffensive, thoroughly enjoyable experience that doesn't need detailed analysis. Take it as it is, lap it up, feel good about yourself and then move on.Peter Mullan and Jane Horrocks, though not a couple one would automatically think to put together, play perfectly against each other as the couple nearing their silver wedding anniversary. Knowing the musical talent that brought Horrocks to the fore, it is an almost agonizing wait for her to be given her chance to sing but you'll be satisfied to know she has a few moments in the limelight. Though Mullan may not be a natural singer, he handles his numbers very well and there is no danger of him 'doing' a Peirce Brosnan (in Mamma Mia!) or Russell Crowe (in Les Mis\u00e9rables).The central trio of MacKay, Guthrie and Mavor gel well, hold the attention, engage us and bounce well off each other, but the jaw-on-the-floor performer here is Antonia Thomas. She has been sorely missing from my life since she moved on from the dark, twisted and utterly fantastic Misfits and it's good to see her back on screen after such an absence. She performs well and is the equal of her peers here but when she sings\u0085 Wow! There are more than sufficient high points in Sunshine on Leith to forgive all the missed opportunities and false starts. Given the choice, I would embrace another twenty doses of Sunshine on Leith than a single, torturous repeat experience of Les Mis\u00e9rables.It was an eight star film when I emerged that settled comfortably into a six star once the euphoria had subsided. Sweet, fun, very enjoyable indeed, Sunshine on Leith is sure to be an absolutely huge hit with the 'only go to the cinema once a year' brigade. When the nights grow dark and cold this is a very good reason to venture out and warm your soul.\n\n\n\n\n                15 of 20 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 69 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What is the area of Edinburgh where the final scenes take place?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official Facebook\n    \n|\n\n            Official site [Japan]\n    \n|\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nCountry:\nUK\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 4 October 2013 (UK)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Aftab bar Faraze Leith\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nEdinburgh, Scotland, UK\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $8,804,555        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Entertainment Film Distributors, DNA Films, Black Camel Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n100 min\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Large numbers of hopefulls audition, hoping to be selected. Throughout the day, more and more people are eliminated, and the competition gets harder. Eventually, approximately a dozen dancers must compete for a few spots, each hoping to impress the director with their dancing skill. But, is this really what the director is looking for?\nWritten by\nMurray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n audition\n|\n based on stage musical\n|\n dancer\n|\n discipline\n|\n strictness\n|\u00a0See All (40)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Movie Event Of 1986!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Because of her dancing inexperience, Audrey Landers is generally not seen in wide shots of the entire cast dancing, but is inserted in close-ups. A dance double is clearly seen in long shots of \"One\".        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nSeveral of Larry's dance directions were repeated as background noise behind other scenes. One example is during the opening credits when the auditioning dancers are lined up outside the theater Larry's voice is heard counting down and making calls such as \"walk walk walk\" and he gives these exact same calls in the next scene. Another is when Cassie is reminiscing in the dressing rooms Larry can be heard saying, \"Make it strong, guys\" when he has just said this in an earlier shot of the auditions.

I have seen the show on Broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production, the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that I don't even know where to begin. First of all, for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production, let me assure you that IRL when you audition for a play, the director, producer, and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer. A real theatrical audition, whether it be for a play or a musical, rarely takes more than five minutes. If you're auditioning as a dancer, you get shown a 64-bar dance combination once, you do it, and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out. Michael Bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little. The play is about these dancers. First of all, director Richard Attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the Cassie/Zach relationship and by casting Michael Douglas as Zach. In the play, you NEVER see Zach...he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with Cassie is barely touched upon. Cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to Larry (a character who is not even in the play)was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about. Major musical numbers were cut or rethought. The opening number in the play \"I Hope I Get It\" shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated. In the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance (can you say \"Audrey Landers\"). \"Goodbye 12, Goodbye 13, Hello Love\", a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as \"Surprise, Surprise\" mainly a vehicle for the late Gregg Burge as Richie. The show's most famous song, \"What I Did for Love\" which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance, becomes just another standard love song in the film, performed tiredly by a miscast Allyson Reed as Cassie. Jeffrey Hornaday's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to Michael Bennett' original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers, the choreography has to be special. There are a couple of good dancers in the film, the previously mentioned Gregg Burge as Richie, Michelle Johnston as Bebe, and Janet Jones as Judy, but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do, yet Audrey Landers, who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time, is given one of the show's best numbers, \"Dance 10, Looks 3.\" I will admit that the finale, \"One\" is dazzling, but you have to wait almost two hours for that. I would say that if you never saw A CHORUS LINE onstage, this film might be worth a look, but if you are a devotee of the original Broadway musical...be afraid...be very afraid.\n\n\n\n\n                48 of 68 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 100 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Soon, two children, Tommy and Annika, venture into the house only to meet up with Pippi. The three soon become friends and get into various adventures together, including cleaning the floor with scrubbing shoes, dodging the \"splunks\", going down a river in barrels, and helping Pippi with the problem of having to go to a children's home. Older children will probably get the most out of this movie.\nWritten by\nAmelia Chanowith \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n child with a gun\n|\n gun\n|\n young girl\n|\n runaway child\n|\n swimming\n|\u00a0See All (49)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nGreat fun for the whole family!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n Add content advisory for parents\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    A natural redhead, Tami Erin's hair was dyed a more red shade for the film.

The eyes are slightly animated, blinking occasionally, and focuses on the titles below: \"Columbia Pictures Presents\" appears first which fades out, then the \"An Adham/Moshay/Mehlman Production of\" credit rolls into place from the left and fades, then the \"A Ken Annakin Film\" that also rolls into place from the right and fades, and finally, the film's title, \"The Adventures of Pippi Longstocking,\" which fades into place. The eyes focus on the \"New\" that suddenly bounces into place from the left (right between \"The\" and \"Adventures,\" which conveniently part to make room for it). The eyes then look at the camera and the left eye winks for a second. Then the scene dissolves to the credit sequence proper.

After all, the Pippi books are silly and light-hearted, so why shouldn't a movie version be? The character of Pippi is a great character study for kids: She is imaginative, creative, confident and above all, a good-willed and courteous child. Anyone who expects her and the stories she stars in to be methodical depictions of the serious side of life should re-examine his/her life and priorities. Maybe then the detractors will realize that life can be fun, at all ages.\n\n\n\n\n                13 of 17 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 36 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Can you tell us about the strange airplane- the autogiro?\n\n\nQ:\n more about the Pitcairn Autogiro\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Sony Movie Channel [United States]\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nSweden\n|\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 29 July 1988 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: As Novas Aventuras da Pipi das Meias Altas\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nAmelia Island, Florida, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$5,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $933,462,\n31 July 1988 \n\nGross USA: $3,569,939        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $3,569,939        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Columbia Pictures, Longstocking Productions, Svensk Filmindustri (SF) \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n104 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

There he is made the servant of a wealthy Egyptian who misunderstands him, and has him thrown into prison. He shows his God-given gift by interpreting the dreams of two other prisoners. Eventually, the Pharaoh begins to be plagued by dreams, and sends for Joseph, who interprets them and saves Egypt in the process. He is made second in command to Pharaoh, and has most of Egypt's grain stored. Eventually his brothers arrive in Egypt to buy food because of famine, and he must forgive them. Then the dreams that had angered his brothers, were in reality prophecies that had come from God.\nWritten by\nAnthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n bible\n|\n egypt\n|\n four word title\n|\n direct to video\n|\n colon in title\n|\u00a0See All (39)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Biography\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n History\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    A character that is not mentioned in this film is Joseph's sister, Dinah.

However, Joseph is one of the most precious examples of a man who trusted God with everything he had and did, and how God was with him throughout his life.  Joseph, King of Dreams doesn't quite reflect that total, precious trust in my opinion.  However, this is a children's animated story and I know that some liberty has to be taken to get the point across to kids in a way that they will be both entertained, and remember well.  This story does achieve that goal in spades.  My nieces and nephew are glued to the set whenever we put this movie in, and my oldest niece can almost recite it verbatim.  \nI can just imagine how hard it must be for the actors to put life and feeling into an animated character, and all of the actors who lent their voices were positively excellent.   I gave this film an overall rating of 8 - if you have little children and are wondering how in the world to introduce your kids to the greatest story ever told, here's your answer for a stupendous start.\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 20 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 37 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

In order to gain a bail-out from the wealthy Mrs Teasdale, the government appoints Rufus T Firefly as its president. However, Mr Firefly shuns the pomp and pretentiousness of government; along with the prudence and rationality of it too. Meanwhile, the neighbouring country of Sylvania is plotting to overthrow Freedonia and sends Pinky and Chicolini to spy on Firefly. War seems inevitable.\nWritten by\ngrantss \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n absurd comedy\n|\n satire\n|\n political satire\n|\n slapstick comedy\n|\n farce\n|\u00a0See All (173)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nGROUCHO as Rufus T.

Producer Herman J. Mankiewicz had just supervised the shooting of another Paramount comedy, Million Dollar Legs (1932), starring W.C. Fields. Herman's younger brother Joseph L. Mankiewicz had written that film's original story about a fictional country, Klopstokia, beset by chaotic foreign intrigue, nutty spies, and internal political strife. The cast even featured a young actress named Susan Fleming, playing the President's daughter, who was to become Harpo Marx's betrothed two years later.

In the next shot, the bottle is in front Groucho, next to his glass. In a later shot, both glass and bottle are missing from the table.

It was the last film the Marx Brothers would do for Paramount before going over to MGM.  Duck Soup is an anarchic comedy where the main characters never live by the rules and rebel as a result.  The Marx Brothers put out some of the greatest comedies that rarely has been matched.  It is a satire about the nature of war, politics, and affairs of the state.  Duck Soup(1933) is a great example of a film that can easily induce a person into bursts of laughter.\n\n\n\n\n                33 of 58 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 288 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n Did Groucho Marx utter a racial epithet in this film?\n\n\nQ:\n Is this movie based on a book?\n\n\nQ:\n Any films with a similar mirror gag?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 17 November 1933 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Die Marx Brothers im Krieg\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nLoja, Granada, Andaluc\u00eda, Spain\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $103,800        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Paramount Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n69 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(Western Electric Noiseless Recording)    \n\nColor:\n Black and White\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.37 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The characters themselves were underdeveloped and very one-dimensional. This being said, when I found out that Disney was going to begin airing the actual variety show from Sonny with a Chance, I was extremely hesitant to watch. I'm nineteen; I grew up on Nickelodeon's All That, a show that's truly one of the best kid shows ever aired. This coupled with the whole Disney versus Nick fight many people continue to argue over had me underwhelmed and uninterested.I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this show. It's funny, and the new members they've brought to the cast are nothing to scoff at. It definitely has potential to turn Disney's falling ratings around, but there are still several things that I feel prevent the show from really bringing Disney back.The sketches, while funny, are very similar to All That sketches. Tantrum Girl is equivalent to Ask Ashley. The Spanish sketch is similar to Pierre Escargot. What will be Disney's downfall is trying too hard to create a great show. If Disney's writers can stop trying to imitate a hit 90's series and make So Random their own, this show could really do well. Now that All That is coming back to Nickelodeon though, it's definitely going to be hard for Disney to have a variety show. You can say all you want about So Random being wonderful, but go take a look at Youtube and watch some original All That. So Random has some major growing to do if it's going to keep enough interest, especially with All That airing again. All in all, this show has a great deal of potential.\n\n\n\n\n                1 of 3 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 16 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

But when a rival camp, Camp Star, run by famous music producer Axel Turner opens across the lake, it causes many Camp Rock campers and counselors to ditch Camp Rock and join Camp Star. Mitchie finds herself too busy running the camp and preparing for the \"Camp Wars\" to have much fun, but Shane and friends help her open up and look on the bright side of summer. The Camp Rock gang spends the summer preparing for the dramatic battle of the bands; while still maintaining to have fun.\nWritten by\nLexi Pearl \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n romeo and juliet\n|\n disney channel original movie\n|\n second part\n|\n sequel\n|\n female protagonist\n|\u00a0See All (5)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Music\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nChloe Bridges, who plays Dana in this film, was up for the part of Mitchie in Camp Rock (2008) that eventually went to Demi Lovato.

Before the two can have their happily ever after, the Emperor assigns them a secret mission, to escort three princesses to Qui Gong, China. Mushu is determined to drive a wedge between the couple after he learns that he will lose his guardian job if Mulan marries into the Li family. After the princesses unexpectedly fall in love with the Gang of Three, Mulan decides to help them escape the fate of marrying men they do not love. This contradicts the Emperor's orders and forces him to put Mulan's relationship with Shang into question. They are attacked by Mongolians, and the fate of China hangs in the balance.\nWritten by\nMegan Burney \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n china\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n princess\n|\n presumed dead\n|\n interrupted wedding\n|\u00a0See All (51)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nHuns beware, this girl's gonna beat you into the next year.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Action\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    When Mulan is putting luggage onto the carriage, a hidden Mickey can be seen on the purple luggage.

It was direct to DVD. I gave this movie a chance though despite my opinion on some of the other Disney straight to video sequels and boy am I glad I did as this movie is a ball to watch. The movie's plot is simple but perfectly functioning it is the story about Shang and Mulan being engaged to marry but before the wedding having to transport three princesses to another country for an arranged marriage that will end the war, all the time Mushu trying to destroy Mulan's wedding and the three princesses falling in love with three warriors from the first film. The movies scenery and animation are ace almost living up to the ridiculously high bar of the first. Now while the characters are flat and generic, with only the characters from the first standing out, they are funny and provide some cool character arcs. The direction lends this picture an amazing sense of pace despite the movie curiously lacking laid out acts. It makes for some funny jokes cute animation and fast paced even with a generic and schmaltzy plot. So overall a fun movie worth checking out in hd!\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 7 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 82 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

While the police are chasing the criminal, there is a mess at Granny's house involving Little Red Hiding Hood, The Wolf, The Woodsman and Granny, disturbing the peace in the forest. They are all arrested by the impatient Chief Grizzly. Detective Nicky Flipper is in charge of the investigation, and each accused gives his/her own version of the incident. Flipper uses the information to disclose the identity of the evil Goody Bandit.\nWritten by\nClaudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n scene of the crime\n|\n female protagonist\n|\n male antagonist\n|\n slimehouse\n|\n little red riding hood character\n|\u00a0See All (84)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nArmed And Dangerously Dumb                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Crime\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Mystery\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for some mild action and thematic elements\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    (at around 36 mins) After Kirk the Woodsman gets his call back, Tommy, the lizard director says, \"I have to be in a circle wipe, across town.\" A circle wipe is an effect in television and cinematography in which an image appears as a dot in the center of the screen, then expands to full size while overlaying the preceding image. This is exactly how Tommy appears on the screen when talking to Kirk.

Hope there is more like it coming!\n\n                        2 May 2006 | by roccoand\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nA few months ago I was speaking with a friend who runs a drive-in movie theater. He asked me what movies I may want to see when he opens for the season. I remembered seeing ads for \"hoodwinked\" but never caught it in the theater so I told him I'd like to see it. He remembered the film and played it last weekend.As it turned out, I could only bring my 9 year old daughter and 2 year old son because my wife had some sort of meeting. I really wasn't looking forward to seeing it with a 2 year old but surprisingly he watched the entire movie! That was a first for him. My 9 year old girl loved it laughing out loud every few minutes. Her favorite characters were the singing goat and the squirrel. I thoroughly enjoyed it too and will buy the DVD on my way home today so I can show the rest of the family (and see it a few more time myself).Thanks for making such a wholesome and clean movie that is NOT lame in any way at all. It was genuinely clever, original, entertaining and funny, very very funny. I sincerely hope you make movies like this for years to come and that each one is more successful. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\n                73 of 86 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 271 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The early songs are extremely good and worthy of any high end musical out there. The lead Ella Hunt is a star in the making with not only great vocals, but a believable performance as Anna. Whilst she could stand firm in any west end musical, I feel her talents are destined to stay with the silver screen, as she is able to capture beautifully subtle facial expressions which make the character very likeable and real.The support vocals and acting are very good from some and ok from others, but overall it never lives up to the strength of the opening 30 minutes.The horror zombie element was very well done and a similar quality to Shaun of the Dead, but I wonder if this could have actually been two separate films. One musical and one comedy horror, as it did both fairly well, but for me they didn't mesh together well enough to sustain for the whole run time.Not enough cool zombie kills for horror fans and not enough quality songs for musical fans.Overall though, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to any fan of either genre.\n\n\n\n\n                76 of 102 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 193 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Or should she just wash that man out of her hair? Bloody Mary is the philosopher of the island and it's hard to believe she could be the mother of Liat who has captured the heart of Lt. Joseph Cable USMC. While waiting for action in the war in the South Pacific, sailors and nurses put on a musical comedy show. The war gets closer and the saga of Nellie Forbush and Emile de Becque becomes serious drama.\nWritten by\nDale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n u.s. navy\n|\n singing\n|\n based on stage musical\n|\n tony award source\n|\n polynesia\n|\u00a0See All (67)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe entertainment world's most wonderful entertainment!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\u00a0|\n War\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The soundtrack album for the film was the first Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II film soundtrack to be issued in stereo, the same year that the mono version was issued. (Because stereo LP's were not possible until 1958, the movie soundtrack albums of Oklahoma! (1955), Carousel (1956) and The King and I (1956) were issued in mono between 1955 and 1956, the stereo versions in 1958.)

George Brackett:\n[fuming]\nCable, it is a common mistake for boys of your age and athletic ability to underestimate men who have reached their maturity. Young women frequently find older men attractive, strange as it may seem. I myself am over fifty. I am a bachelor. And Cable, I do not, by any means, consider myself th-r-rough.\n[to Harbison, who is trying not to laugh]\nCapt. George Brackett:\nWhat's the matter, Bill?\nCmdr. Bill Harbison:\n...\n                [...]\nSee more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nCrazy Credits\n    There are probably more dubbed singing voices in this film than in any other screen version of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, but the only one which actually receives screen credit is that of Giorgio Tozzi, who dubs the singing voice of Emile de Becque (Rosanno Brazzi). This is because Tozzi was a renowned bass-baritone with the Metropolitan Opera.        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nOriginal roadshow version ran 171 minutes. 20 minutes were edited for general release, subsequently shown in theaters, television, and home video. These scenes were:\nA non-musical bridge during the song \"Bloody Mary\" in which Mary attempts to sell a shrunken head to a sea-bee. Mary calls him a \"stingy stinker,\" and it resumes with the chorus of the song.As Luther explains to Cable what goes on on the island of Bali Ha'i, he sings a short reprise of the song of that name.Nellie and Emile repeat the chorus to \"Some Enchanted Evening\" before kissing. In the general release, the chorus was removed from this reprise.Much of the scene at Bali Ha'i, including shots of Cable and Billis's entry to the island, and much of the Boar's Tooth ceremony.After the party, Emile's surprise was that he put a towel on his head and sang a comic reprise of \"I'm Gonna Wash That man Right Outta My Hair\".-Then* his children walked out to meet Nellie. As it stands in the edited version, it seems as if the children themselves were the surprise.\nLuther complains about the absence of gas for the generator during rehearsalsLuther asks a nurse about Nellie as the ships go out.With overture, ent'racte, and exit music, this complete cut was approximately 175 minutes. Some people claim that the original full-length version shows Lt. Cable getting shot and falling dead, but others say that this is never shown. As shown in most prints, Emile merely reports Cable's death, just as he does in the play, and Cable is shown lying dead as the natives prepare to bury him.

Mostly wonderful film version although I agree with most posters that the color filters during the songs can be a little distracting. Mitzi Gaynor is fine as Nurse Nellie Forbush in singing, dancing, and especially acting that I don't understand the criticism against her. Rossano Brazzi is likewise (although his singing, like the other cast members, was dubbed) as paramour Emile de Becque. John Kerr does indeed seem stilted and the dubbed singing of him is so obvious and I can't believe completely his love for France Nuyen. Ms. Nuyen is luminous, by the way. Juanita Hall and Ray Walston (who I first encountered as Mr. Hand in Fast Times at Ridgemount High) also lend fine support. That all said, this is classic R & H all the way in line with The Sound of Music, The King and I, Oklahoma!, and Carousel. P.S. Thurl Ravenscroft was the singing voice of Stewpot in the \"There is Nothing Like a Dame\" number. You might know him best as Tony the tiger and the singer of \"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\" in How the Grinch Who Stole Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 6 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 131 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

He meets a nightclub singer Terry McKay who is also on her way home to her longtime boyfriend. She sees him as just another playboy and he sees her as stand-offish but over several days they soon find they've fallen in love. Nickie has never really worked in his life so they agree that they will meet again in six months time atop the Empire State building. This will give them time to deal with their current relationships and for Nickie to see if he can actually earn a living. He returns to painting and is reasonably successful. On the agreed date, Nickie is waiting patiently for Terry who is racing to join him. Fate intervenes however resulting in misunderstanding and heartbreak and only fate can save their relationship.\nWritten by\ngarykmcd \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n new york city\n|\n rendezvous at top of empire state building\n|\n port\n|\n harbor\n|\n harbour\n|\u00a0See All (79)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nOur Love Affair is a Wondrous Thing!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    A Bollywood film with the title Mann (1999) starring Aamir Khan and Manisha Koirala was inspired by this movie.

Deborah Kerr's unfortunate passing finally got me to pull it out. Should have went with my first choice, Black Narcissus, instead. An Affair to Remember starts off fine, with Cary Grant and Kerr, both engaged to be married, meeting on a voyage across the Atlantic. The first half of the film follows them as they try to avoid each other, but end up falling in love anyway. As they are about to part ways, they agree to meet each other in six months at the top of the Empire State building. So far, it's lovely. Unfortunately, there's an hour left, and, where the first half was a lovely romantic comedy, the second half is all dull melodrama. When Cary and Kerr are apart, the sizzle between them burns out pretty much instantly. And then the film inserts a bunch of precocious children, whom Kerr teaches to sing. There were a couple of fine child actors in classic Hollywood, but the vast majority of them seem like they are being fed lines two seconds before the camera comes on, and then they just repeat it out of rote. If there's a Hell, I'll be surrounded by kids who appeared in classic movies.\n\n\n\n\n                10 of 13 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 198 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What do Nickie and Terry say to each other in French on the ship?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n|\nFrench\n|\nItalian\n\n\nRelease Date: 19 July 1957 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Die gro\u00dfe Liebe meines Lebens\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nCentury City, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nGross USA: $3,850,000        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $3,851,689        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Jerry Wald Productions \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n115 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nStereo\n(Westrex Recording System)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.40 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It taught kids learning curriculums and \"believe in yourself\" lessons. But the show has it's problems. The Dance Songs had repetitive melodies and the voice casts keeps changing every season except for Molly's singing voice. The show started loosing qualities around the end of Season 3 and totally fell apart in most of Season 4 which is why it was cancelled. But Nickelodeon resurrected with a Season 5 but removed almost everything from the first 4 seasons. Zooli is an alright character but shouldn't really be bumped as the main character. Overall Bubble Guppies was a good show. For Season 6, I wish they return some main elements of the first 4 seasons.\n\n\n\n\n                0 of 0 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 26 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Every day bear uses his reassuringly shaggy presence to help solve problems and explore a different topic of the day (for instance \"finding\" or \"helping\"). He also frequently talks to his other friends, Shadow, who tells stories and sings nursery rhymes, and Luna the moon, who helps provide 'The Big Picture'.\nWritten by\nStephanie Paris \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n animal character name in series title\n|\n six word series title\n|\n bear\n|\n muppet\n|\n puppetry\n|\u00a0See All (11)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    A Jim Henson show for preschoolers shown on Playhouse Disney in the late 90s to early 2000s.

It is the only children's program that consistently addresses the everyday aspects of life, such as potty training, cleaning the house, bathing, brushing one's teeth, going to school, etc. The amazing thing is how it's all done in the most entertaining way with fun songs and lots of dancing -- not an easy thing to do well. My kids absolutely love it when Bear feels the Cha Cha Cha coming on! The entire cast is extremely talented. I never hear them talking down to children as I do on many other shows. The segment with Luna is wonderful to open children's minds to contemplation -- it is so soothing.My children, now 3 and 1, have adored this show since they were old enough to hold their heads up and it's one of the few programs that I actually enjoy myself as there is a subtle humor that adults can appreciate. Most importantly, however, this is a show that actually teaches kids about real life while entertaining them and opening their imaginations. My personal favorite of all the current kids shows, and objectively speaking, one of the three best kids shows on TV. Also, the pacing is great and it does not contribute to the short attention span syndrome like so many other kids shows.\n\n\n\n\n                9 of 9 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 27 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Attracted to Irene, Don decides to invest some money in Bob's latest venture, the \"Madame Lucy\" dress shop, in order to give Irene a job there as a model. She is very successful and Bob also becomes attracted to her. Smith, the manager assigns Irene and other models to display gowns at Mrs. Vincent's charity ball, but Irene ruins the gown she was to wear, and appears instead in a quaint blue dress that had belonged to her mother... and it is a big hit. A guest, Princess Minetti, places her as the niece of Ireland's Lady O'Dare, and Irene does not deny the relationship. Smith decides to set her up in a Park Avenue suite as the niece of Lady O'Dare, so that she can attend socially important gatherings wearing and displaying, of course, Madame Lucy gowns. A jealous model tells the truth to a newspaper columnist who writes an expose, which somewhat ...\nWritten by\nLes Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n remake\n|\n character name as title\n|\n forename as title\n|\n model\n|\n dress\n|\u00a0See All (57)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nSiren Irene...

It is one of those sweet, charming (without cloying--it has some wit to it) movies RKO did so well (Ginger Rogers' 5th AVENUE GIRL is another I recently saw--thank goodness for Turner Classic Movies). Towards the end of this movie, Ray Milland's character discovers Anna Neagle's Irene dancing by herself, lost in thought and emotion. He and we watch, unperceived by Irene, and the dance was an unexpected delight. While the choreography could have used more variation (certain moves are repeated too much, and some of them have her shoulders up more than is ideal), Anna N. proves herself a graceful, expressive dancer; I hope to see more of her dancing, if it exists in films. The beginning of the dance also uses subtle slow-motion to good effect, which it occurred to me I haven't seen often, if at all, in musicals from this era. I wonder why that wasn't used more, as it would seem to be a relatively easy effect to employ. Anyway, I recommend IRENE, and look forward to taking my own recommendation to see the rest of it soon.\n\n\n\n\n                11 of 13 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 15 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

This also marks the return of Robin Williams as Genie, where the sequel and television show had Dan Castellaneta. Of course, since Robin returns he has a gag every ten seconds, but most of them land pretty well. The songs are quite good, and the characters are really quite fun. The animation is not that great, but it works well enough where you don't really notice it. I recommend this finale to the Alddin trilogy.My rating-*** out of ****. 81 mins.

Her kind mother, who runs an umbrella shop, won't hear of her marrying, particularly as Guy has yet to complete his compulsory military service. Genevieve is heartbroken when he leaves for his army service in colonial Algeria and is upset to have received only one letter from him in two months. Her mother's solution to this situation is kind diamond-merchant Roland Cassard, who has helped them in the past.\nWritten by\ngarykmcd \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n separation\n|\n love\n|\n shop\n|\n military service\n|\n auto mechanic\n|\u00a0See All (101)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nFOR ALL THE YOUNG LOVERS OF THE WIDE, WIDE WORLD...                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    Ranked number 51 non-English-speaking film in the critics' poll conducted by the BBC in 2018.

Everyone seems to be captivated with Catherine Deneuve -- which fascination is understandable, I admit.  But lack of attention to the centrality of Guy's role -- loved, betrayed, redeemed -- and blindness to the acting and handsomeness of Nino, are totally, totally unforgivable!

Former vizier-usurper Jafar was banished to a genie lamp, but is dug up by ambitious simpleton crook Abis Mal, whom Jafar manages to manipulate his three wishes so he can regain his power and return to Agrabah for revenge. His egotistic formerly trusted parrot Iago has already managed to cash in on the palace's gratitude, but is facing conflicting loyalties when his former master reveals himself to him. Genie is finally back and must take on a magic duel against Jafar, whose dirty tricks land Aladdin and Jasmine in the dungeons.\nWritten by\nKGF Vissers \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n genie character\n|\n competition\n|\n drinking\n|\n false identity\n|\n corporal punishment\n|\u00a0See All (89)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Aladdin adventure continues...        \n\n\nGenres:\n Animation\u00a0|\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    In the first film, the pattern design for Carpet was very detailed. Most likely due to the daunting task of animating something so elaborate, his design was simplified for this and future Aladdin films (Including the animated series).

Later on, when Iago is shouting at Abu to open the cage, for him, the cage now no longer has the lock on it from earlier, enabling Abu to open the cage for him.

He has since moved into the castle and is still having a romance with Jasmine, daughter of the Sultan. The film opens with Aladdin stealing from a thief named Abis Mal (voiced by \"Seinfeld's\" Jason Alexander), and giving the jewels to the poor (ala Robin Hood).\nAn angry Abis Mal retreats to the desert, where he accidentally releases genie Jafar, who seeks revenge on Aladdin. With the help of the thief, Jafar plots revenge.Meanwhile, back at the palace, Aladdin has taken Iago the Parrot (Gilbert Gottfried), Jafar's ex-confidante, under his wing (so to speak). And the Blue Genie (this time voiced by Dan \"Homer Simpson\" Castellanetta, instead of Robin Williams) shows up after touring the world, singing \"There's nothing in the world quite like a friend!\" and dancing around.\"The Return of Jafar\" seems more like a worthy sequel to 1992's box office smash \"Aladdin,\" and it isn't like other countless straight-to-video sequels that are pure, unadulterated crap.The animation is a bit more bland than it was in the first, but the characters are all voiced by the same actors (save the Blue Genie--who sounds like Williams anyway),  and the story is not entirely stupid. It's actually pretty fun, and seems like those old legends you hear of in ancient tales.And such as in the original, this film is filled with sly references to modern-day things. The first had spoofs/imitations of Woody Allen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, slicer/dicer ads, and much, much more. This film uses a lot of objects that weren't even invented at the time, such as a pool table (wasn't that in this flick?) and the Genie uses other references to modern-day inventions when he comes back from visiting the world.\"Aladdin\" was one of the best of 1992, and this is more than just a worthy sequel, but a worthy continuation of the story (to be concluded in the mess-of-a-sequel \"Aladdin and the King of Thieves,\" which is one to miss).3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 11 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 82 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n So why did Jafar save Aladdin from falling over the waterfall?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 20 May 1994 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Aladdin and the Return of Jafar\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$3,500,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Walt Disney Home Video, Disney Television Animation, Disneytoon Studios \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n69 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby SR\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.78 : 1 / (high definition)\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

In the case of this film, the dancing is central to the survival of the colony, all of which is just metaphor for having imagination and invincible spirit to overcome the odds.The chances for Happy Feet Two being sappy and repetitive were significant, but its ebullient spirit, gifted voices like Robin Williams,' and a creative plot make the penguins an unlikely symbol of intrepid imagination. Anyway, when I hid in a trench in New Zealand to see the little lovelies trundle home as they always do at the same time each day, I was hooked to see an animation renewing our cultural romance with penguins and the beast fable itself.\n\n\n\n\n                6 of 11 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 91 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What type of penguin is Mumble?\n\n\nQ:\n Who sings the Giacomo Puccini aria [\"E lucevan le stelle\"] that Erik sings after Brian the Beachmaster refuses to help Mumble?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nOfficial Sites:\n\n            Official site\n    \n\n\n\n\nCountry:\nAustralia\n|\nUSA\n|\nAntarctica\n|\nNew Zealand\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 15 December 2011 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Tazizu ta'raglayim 2\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nFox Studios, Moore Park, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$135,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $21,237,068,\n20 November 2011 \n\nGross USA: $64,006,466        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $159,197,038        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures, Kennedy Miller Mitchell \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n117 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nDolby Digital\n| DTS\n(as Datasat Digital Sound)| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.39 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Anjali realizes that she has fallen in love with Rahul but she's too late because Rahul has already fallen for Tina Malhotra. Heartbroken, Anjali leaves the city. Tina and Rahul get married and soon Tina becomes pregnant, giving birth to a daughter which they call Anjali. Due to complications during pregnancy, Tina passes away. Anjali is brought up by her father, and each year on her birthday he allows his daughter to read one of her mother's letters. Through these letters she learns that her mother (Tina) knew that another Anjali was in love with Rahul, and vows to bring them together again.\nWritten by\nSoumitra \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n best friend\n|\n tomboy\n|\n principal\n|\n male female relationship\n|\n heartbreak\n|\u00a0See All (60)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe Best                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    The scene in which Kajol walks up to Rani and Shah Rukh Khan dressed up in a blinding pink and orange dress, is laughed at by none other than Farah Khan and Manish Malhotra sitting on the stairs.

This is a film from an era before he got into big cinema and expatriate Indians. The ensemble cast consisted of highly popular or young and upcoming stars like Shahrukh Khan, Kajol, Salman Khan and Rani Mukherjee. Rumors are that the film was actually the brainchild of Kajol and SRK who had worked with Karan on Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and believed that KJo had it in him to direct good films. They helped Karan sort out a rather muddled story and had their way with the character development for the most part. It is quite fitting that a young director of 26 yrs would want to explore romantic relationships in the environment of young folks in a college setting. What is the most important factor in love? Is it lust or is it friendship? SRK plays Rahul (the continuation of his DDLJ Raj persona) whose best buddy is the tomboy Anjali (Kajol in a tomboy Simran persona). There is lots of friendship but not much attraction on either side. Then a young, different, attractive young woman Tina (Rani in an excellent hottie role) arrives on the scene and the mixture gets stirred up. Rahul feels the attraction (lust?) for Tina and at the same time Anjali discovers that she loves Rahul, but has no wiles to attract him. Rahul confesses to his best buddy his love for Tina and Anjali leaves the scene and goes away. Tina dies in childbirth but leaves letters for her daughter asking her to make sure Rahul and Anjali hook up again as she felt that she came between the true love they had for each other. The rest of the film deals with Rahul meeting Anjali again only to find her with another man in her life, and how the story gets resolved to give us the obligatory happy ending.What I did not like about Kuch Kuch Hota Hai \u00961. It is like a penny romance with no real deep meaning \u0096 I hate when that happens to what otherwise has the potential to be a good film. 2. Everything is stereotyped \u0096 relationships are perfect, lives are perfect\u0085. I wish some more exploration of the conflict between love and lust had been done in a more substantial manner. 3. The characters were dressed in Lycra for the entire first half \u0096 no doubt to make them look young! But it was kind of annoying\u0085 4. The basketball matches were not really played as per rules were they? Even I know how many steps you can take before it is called walking! 5. I am so conflicted about this film \u0096 it is like a candy bar that one cannot help taking guilty pleasure in, but you know that in the end it leaves nothing of substance behind.What I like in the film: 1. The overall feel-good feel of the film. 2. The story \u0096 it begins with a funeral pyre and ends with 15 minutes of copious tears but the middle is funny, romantic and happy. 3. Many moments between SRK and Kajol \u0096 this is why the duo was the best romantic pair out there for so long. In many moments when Kajol is a tomboy buddy, in the second half when she is the demure Anjali \u0096 she and SRK sizzle on screen. Some moments are my particular favorites \u0096 when Anjali leaves and goes off - the entire train station scene is brilliant \u0096 Rahul watching the train leave, Anjali watching him. The first meeting between the two at the summer camp, the scene at night on the bench, the second basketball match-up at the camp \u0096 the friendship/attraction is palpable. 4. The music \u0096 the movie has some of the best music and awesome song picturization. Koi Mil Gaya remains my favorite stage song \u0096I love SRK's tongue in cheek Elvis impersonation and the contrast between the hot Tina in a short short silver dress and the tomboy Anjali in red overalls! The title song is contemplative and beautifully picturized \u0096 sets the stage immediately for the conflict between these three characters. 5. The summer camp stuff is campy to the max \u0096 but who will not feel good about a bunch of kids singing, dancing and having fun! 6. The supporting cast is actually very good \u0096 Farida Jalal as the Mum, Anupam Kher, Himani, Archana, even Johny Lever. The kids are a bit annoying \u0096 but aren't most film kids? 7. The acting \u0096 Shahrukh does extremely well in this film as the young man who is conflicted about his own feelings, unable to sort them out, unable to understand the difference between love and lust, and in the end almost unable to express his true feelings when he does realize them. He also shows considerable maturity as the father, the widowed son \u0096 this is a role that allows him to express a lifetime of personal growth and to do it well. Kajol is brilliant as the tomboy who grows up fast, as the demure young woman who has always known her mind but never really expressed her feelings \u0096 good girls don't do that you know! She is consistently good throughout the film \u0096 maybe her best role opposite SRK. Rani is excellent as the sexy Tina, even Salman is less annoying than usual.A word of warning to lovers of serious cinema \u0096 there is nothing for you here! But if you want to be entertained by a feel-good film then by all means rent it. If you do not hate SRK and Kajol you could even buy the film \u0096 you will watch it more than once! And if you show the film to your non-Indian average movie watcher friends they might get seriously addicted to Hindi cinema.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 10 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 113 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

I think that it represents the young people of the new generation. Not only do they show how true friendships are developed, but they have comedy and their music is very cool and new. I truly can say that Rebelde is the best Novela that I have ever seen in my life; and believe me!! I was born watching soap operas. All my friends even guy friends are into this Novela. I would recommend anyone who reads this comment to give it a try and watch it. Trust me you would love it and will not want to miss any episodes. If you see it come back to IMDb and write what you think about it, even if you totally hate it.\n\n\n\n\n                21 of 30 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 24 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Kayley enlists the blind, reclusive knight-aspirant Garrett and a goofy two headed dragon to brave the Enchanted Forest and retrieve the magic sword.

Despite a pretty impressive cast, it lacks charm.  The animation is sloppy, the \"humourous\" characters irritating, and the others just dull.  It is filled with dire songs with meaningless lyrics, and the dialogue is just silly.  I don't think Disney has much to fear from this mediocre (at best) offering.The other small detail I had a problem with is the heroine's name; I find it hard to believe there were many Kayleys in Arthurian England.\n\n\n\n\n                7 of 19 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 82 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

These are tiny BlackTrax infrared transmitters which enable the lights to automatically track performers as they move around the stage. When they leave the stage to march through the theatre, you will notice some of these trackers glowing slightly.

An enjoyable romp in today's culture. A tender and soft musical journey from a voice which has barely aged since 1976. You'll find yourself bobbing your head at times to the rhythmic melodies.

My 2 year old daughter and 3 1/2 year old son loves this show! Before they were in love with Go Diego Go, Dora, and Jake and the Neverland Pirates! Now they are running around pretending to be doctors! My son now operates on his trains and whenever his sister falls he grabs his bag and runs to her aid. The little tidbits at the end of the show help to re-enforce some of the habits we are trying to instill in our children as well! Very helpful! I am not sure why the show has gotten such low ratings? I can't imagine any parent that could resist watching the show and having such well rounded character inspiring their children to be great! I even enjoy watching Doc Macstuffin with them! Thanks for such and inspiring show!\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 14 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 16 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

All other releases of the film (including the original roadshow run, the film's general release, re-releases, the 30th anniversary VHS, and the DVD) are without the logo, and simply say \"Warner Bros-Seven Arts presents\". But oddly enough, the cover of the film soundtrack album says \"Warner Bros. Pictures Presents\", and shows the famous Warner Bros. shield.

Like that later film, \"Camelot\" seems to go out of its way to cast its musical with stars who can't sing or dance to save their lives. Instead, the cast seems to be trying to tap into the interest in swinging \"Mod\" London of the mid-60s.  (With Vanessa Redgrave and David Hennings, you have half the cast of Antonioni's \"Blow Up\" [1966]!)  The film also tries to appeal to both a family audience *and* discerning adult viewers simultaneously.  I can't imagine parents being happy about the frank earthy sexuality of \"The Lusty Month of May,\" or the overt adultery of the plotline--but people looking for adult fare would be annoyed at the attempts at sweetness and light being thrown in as well.  Obviously, no one from either side was too happy, because this was a *big* flop for Warner Bros. when it came out.  Seeing it in a *huge* theatre in 70mm may help maintain interest visually (the costumes are striking), but this will be lost if watching it on video (esp. if it's a \"pan-and-scan\" instead of a letterboxed version).  This is a movie only for those who are die-hard musical fans that are willing to sit through anything--because this is one of the movies that effectively killed the genre's popularity.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 11 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 109 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n What other movies have been made about the triangle between Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere?\n\n\nQ:\n What is 'Camelot' about?\n\n\nQ:\n Was King Arthur a real person?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 25 October 1967 (USA)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0442\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\nAlc\u00e1zar de Segovia, Segovia, Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$13,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Warner Bros./Seven Arts \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n179 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\n4-Track Stereo\n(35 mm prints)| 70 mm 6-Track\n(70 mm prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n(Technicolor)    \n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Still, given that I was watching it while flying across the Atlantic, it was a nice time-passer and kept my attention.The film begins with Naina and her mother meeting up with a rather vacuous old schoolmate of Naina. While Naina graduated top of her class and is at the top of her class in medical school, this meeting with the schoolmate left Naina feeling that she's missing something...fun. So, on a lark, she decides to drop everything and head off on an adventure--and she picks the same destination the vacuous schoolmate chose. There, Naina slowly learns to unwind and meets sexy Bunny (he is a man--not some furry--despite the name). They hit it off and seem to be falling in love but one HUGE problem stands in their way--Bunny has vowed never to marry and wants to travel the world and experience EVERYTHING. What's to happen? See the film.Like the typical Bollywood film, this romance is predictable and there's lots of singing. You can't fault the film for this--this is THE format that Indian films follow these days and very few deviate from this. My problem with the film, and it's minor, was the silly scene were Naina takes off her glasses and instantly people notice how hot she is! What a clich\u00e9....plus my wife was much like Naina when I met her but is hot with and without her glasses! Still, it's fun and worth seeing.\n\n\n\n\n                7 of 9 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 146 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

I can see where children under the age of six (6) or so might not be as captivated as they would be for PBS style kids' programming: expecting simple graphics and age readability appropriate dialogue such as few syllables; short sentences; concrete familiar references; simple, not abstract concepts. Add to this mix some scary visuals. Also, some of the songs are teen and above. So \u0085 Second, for all ages (except above mentioned) the blend of straight dialogue with pop music (some oldies; some newer) dialogue to move the story forward was artfully blended. Admittedly I didn't quite get it in the beginning, but I was able to overcome some of my dumbness and learned to appreciate it. The singing vocal quality from the voice actors was surprisingly good. Third, computer hardware and graphics' programs continue to evolve and are producing scaringly realistic animations: surfaces, modeling, mattes, compositing naturalistic movement. Kudos to all involved. Fourth, the film's messages of seeing in a new way; looking under the surface; love - all make the film worth watching just for that reason.\n\n\n\n\n                52 of 62 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 172 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

But de facto leader Robin is determined to remedy the situation, and be seen as a star instead of a sidekick. If only they could get the hottest Hollywood film director to notice them. With a few madcap ideas and a song in their heart, the Teen Titans head to Tinsel Town, certain to pull off their dream. But when the group is radically misdirected by a seriously super villain and his maniacal plan to take over the Earth, things really go awry. The team finds their friendship and their fighting spirit failing, putting the very fate of the Teen Titans themselves on the line.\nWritten by\nWarner Bros.

Sir Ringo Starr, drummer of The Beatles has it; sent by the girl (who's to be sacrificed) as a gift. Clang, Ahme, Bhuta, and several cult members leave for London to retrieve the ring. After several failed attempts to steal the ring, they confront him in an Indian restaurant. Ringo learns that if he does not return the ring soon, he will become the next sacrifice. Ringo then discovers that the ring is stuck on his finger. Its a race against time; John Lennon, Sir Paul McCartney, and George Harrison try to protect their friend while they're all being chased not only by Clang and his minions, but also by two mad scientists and the Chief Inspector of Scotland yard. Will Ringo be saved, or will he be sacrificed?\nWritten by\nErin Pelicano \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n ring\n|\n mad scientist\n|\n human sacrifice\n|\n the beatles\n|\n drummer\n|\u00a0See All (83)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nStop Worrying!

Richard Lester'sstuck deep in Buster Keaton mode (the Beatles Digs seem an homage to \"theElectric House\") and he never made his modernized version of Buster workbetter.        Though it lacks \"Hard Day's Nights\" quicksilver verbal wit; there areexcellent visual jokes to pick up the slack, and the Beatles acting, FAR from being bad, hits just the right tone of throwaway sillyness. The supporting cast are perfect.     Of the seven Beatles songs, I would say three( \"Help\" \"The NIght Before\" and \"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\") are A plus Beatles, setting the bar very high indeed.        This style of comedy, as I suggested, had one foot in silent comedy and one in hip detachment; and if that works for you, \"Help!\" should prove timeless.\n\n\n\n\n                3 of 3 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 132 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

The familiar artwork is breathtaking and fares far better than the recent DOUG in movie form. Angelica gets to steal the show like she always does, and sings a sample of Blondie's \"One Way Or Another\". Simply put, a great way for kids to escape the horrors of network television. As all that can be best explained, you know exactly what to predict here. The songs are nice, but they're nothing to brag about except for when the end credits scroll by.\n\n\n\n\n                4 of 5 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 74 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n At the end of the movie, what did Stu fly on to rescue the kids?\n\n\nQ:\n How come Dil can't talk, but the babies in the nursery were able to sing a song?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 1 July 1999 (Israel)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Ipanat\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nBudget:$24,000,000\n            (estimated)\n\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $27,321,470,\n22 November 1998 \n\nGross USA: $100,494,675        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $140,894,675        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies, Klasky-Csupo \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n79 min\n|\n83 min\n            (extended)\n    \n\nSound Mix:\nDolby\n| DTS\n(Digital DTS Sound)| SDDS\n\n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.66 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Unfortune...\n\n                        9 September 1999 | by Alcaminhante\n                        \u2013 See all my reviews\n\n\nThe Muppets, we just got to love them !Unfortunely, the same can\u00b4t be said about many of their movie adventures. Most of them were nothing more than a parade of has been actors and ex-television stars, mixed with a couple of Muppet jokes, singing moments and uninteresting plots. Somehow the idea of mixing the Muppets with real locations and images never worked that great, and so. to me at least, most of the movies got always to a point when i was just bored of watching them. I always found them a bit too long. Even when i was a kid i thought like that.I still love the Muppets on tv, that backstage setting was a brilliant creation and the perfect home to those characters and situations. Even the new television series are good. So i always wished for some good movies with the Muppets, but that never seemed to happen.Untill a couple of years ago, a new one came out. That Christmas one, about the classical story of the Ghosts of Christmas Past and the old Scrooge. This movie restored my faith on the Muppets. I loved it, and this time i thought it was too small. I wanted more ! And i loved that cute sad little bunny  hero !Anyway, then i bought this new one, MUPPETS TREASURE ISLAND, and i think it\u00b4s an absolute masterpiece, on what  Muppets are concerned.All the \"problems\" the other movies had are gone, and this finaly looks like a great Muppets movie. No more dull scenes, no more boring guests,  now it\u00b4s got a great storytelling rithm and the perfect pace of a real movie.Funny story, great gags particulary the ones with the rats, fantastic landscapes and scenery, cool songs, and good special effects. It even has Tim Curry in it and a great actor always come in handy. No one  plays a fun villain like him. Oh, and it has Miss Piggy, of course. (Sorry Miss, it won\u00b4t happen again i almost forgot about you... SPLAP ! Ouch !....) :-)So im glad this movie was made, and i can\u00b4t wait to see the next one.So to all of you who think the Muppet movieas are boring to follow, go and see this and forever change your mind. And you so called cool guys, let go of that macho crap atitude, and don\u00b4t be afraid to watch a movie filled with puppets. Don\u00b4t worry, this is nothing like Sesame Street. (thank god !)  :-)A great family movie if ever there was one. A great movie.I want more !\n\n\n\n\n                14 of 20 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 75 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

My Mom taped it for me when I was little and I  would watch it every day. Now my niece does the same thing. I guess it runs in the family! A great movie for the family to sit down and watch together or kids to watch on their own. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!

This can be a confusing reference to 21st-century viewers, who may only be familiar with asbestos as a mineral composite which is now known to cause the lung cancer mesothelioma, but during the first part of the 20th century asbestos was an often-used flame-retardant component in building materials. It also would have been a reference familiar to theater people, since live-performance theaters were at the time required to have a curtain made of asbestos that would separate the stage from the audience in the event of an on-stage fire. In that context, the presence of the curtain in the film is the movie's way of implying that whatever Billy and Peggy are going to do behind the curtain, it will surely be \"hot.\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nGoofs\nThe word \"Premiere\" on the marquee of the theatre at the end is spelled without the final \"e.\"        See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nQuotes\nDorothy Brock:\nNow go out there and be so swell that you'll make me hate you!\n See more \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nA digitally restored and colorized version was recently released.

And based on this unhappy discovery you've decided that you don't like musicals.  Please do not distress yourself and allow me to introduce you to the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930's, starting with 42nd Street, the best of them all.\nLike nearly all the musicals of its time, 42nd Street is a depression-era back stage musical which focuses on the grueling hours that have to be put in by the singers and dancers day after day in preparation of opening night. The film has a fine cast with lovely Bebe Daniels as Dorothy Brock, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Ginger Rogers, George Brent and Warner Baxter, who chews the scenery in every scene he's in as the stage director of 'Pretty Lady'.\nWhat separates films like \"42nd Street\" from the musicals of the 40's and 50's is the daring camera work of dance director Busby Berkeley.  Berkeley loves his chorus girls, and he has no qualms about aiming his camera up their dresses at every opportunity.  One of the sexiest moments in the film comes when the girls try out for the chorus in their street clothes.  Each girl of course is dressed differently from the others, with a different hat (love those cute 30's hats) dress and high-heel shoes.  This variety makes them look hotter than when they're all wearing the same chorus outfit.  When they have to show their legs in the hopes of being chosen,  Berkeley gets his camera down low and gives you a birds eye view of each girl's legs ... first a front view, than they turn and let you get a good look at their calves.  It is a very erotic scene.  Later, when the girls leave their dressing rooms and are coming down the stairs for opening night, Berkeley puts his camera under the stairs and shoots up their dresses as they pass. Again, when the girls emerge from backstage and high-kick out for the opening number, Berkeley has his camera down low at a 45 degree angle, aiming right up the chute of the costumes of the first few girls to dance out on stage.  Further along, all the chorus girls form an arc in one number with their legs wide open and Berkeley tracks right thru their legs all the way around the circle.  You can even see the last girl has a gold ankle bracelet on her left ankle.  Once the production code was strictly enforced after 1934, shots like this were never seen again.\n42nd Street has three great songs, \"You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me\", \"Shuffle Off To Buffalo\" and of course \"42nd Street\".  There have been many revivals of \"42nd Street\", and they often include the best numbers of other films, along with the three I mentioned, including \"Dames\" from the film of the same name, \"Go Into Your Dance\", a terrific number, and \"Lullaby of Broadway\", which is the highlight number from \"Gold-Diggers of 1935\", which has a spectacular tap dance sequence with 100 chorus girls wearing gorgeous, sheer black skirts as part of their chorus outfits.  If musicals often leave you cold, and you haven't given \"42nd Street\" a try, than I suggest that you do so ... and sit close to the television set.\n\n\n\n\n                37 of 40 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 127 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Davis plays matchmaker and introduces Wallace to a pair of beautiful sisters (Betty and Judy) who also have a song-and-dance act. When Betty and Judy travel to a Vermont lodge to perform a Christmas show, Wallace and Davis follow, only to find their former commander, General Waverly, as the lodge owner. A series of romantic mix-ups ensue as the performers try to help the General.\nWritten by\nNorman Cook <cook@ssdgwy.mdc.com> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n christmas\n|\n train\n|\n war veteran\n|\n hotel\n|\n ski lodge\n|\u00a0See All (96)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nTHE MOST FABULOUS MUSIC-AND-MIRTH SHOW IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY!

A new logo, created especially for wide-screen, this logo appears more realistic and features a shot of a canyon with trees around it. The sky is more distant in depth and is full of contrast. The Paramount logo is pretty much the same as before here. The screen credit \"Paramount (with the \"P\" written in their corporate font) proudly presents the first picture in\" first appears over the mountain, and then the VistaVision logo appears, then the Paramount logo plays as usual (with the final notes of the Paramount on Parade march, followed by a bell sound). The Paramount mountain, with minor variations until 1986, served as the basis for the company logo for more than 30 years.

Bing, Fred, the great dancing and the gift of the song White Christmas to a war weary world. However, last Christmas Eve my 13-year-old daughter and I had \"White Christmas\" on the TV as we wrapped last minute gifts. My daughter commented \"I think White Christmas is the best Christmas movie because there are no little kids, no angels or miracles. It's just the story of four people (the entertainers) trying to do something nice for somebody (the Major)\".I'm still more of a \"Holiday Inn\" fan, but now have a new fondness for \"White Christmas\".\n\n\n\n\n                13 of 15 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 228 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\nQ:\n How does the movie end?\n\n\nQ:\n What is \"White Christmas\" about?\n\n\nQ:\n How old were the four major actors when the movie was made?\n\n\n\nSee more\n \u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDetails\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\n\nLanguage:\nEnglish\n\n\nRelease Date: 15 November 1954 (Brazil)\n    \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlso Known As: Irving Berlin's White Christmas\n      \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\nFilming Locations:\n20th Century Fox Studios - 10201 Pico Blvd., Century City, Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n\nEdit\n\nBox Office\n\nOpening Weekend USA: $566,045,\n9 December 2018 \n\nGross USA: $928,298        \n\nCumulative Worldwide Gross: $1,099,207        \n\nSee more on IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\nCompany Credits\n\nProduction Co:\n Paramount Pictures \nSee more\u00a0\u00bb\n      \n\n\n  Show more on\n  IMDbPro\u00a0\u00bb\n  \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime:\n120 min\n\n\nSound Mix:\nMono\n(Western Electric Recording)| Perspecta Stereo\n(optical prints)    \n\nColor:\nColor\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n    \n\n  See full technical specs\u00a0\u00bb\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n|\nContributor Zone\u00a0\u00bb\nContribute to This Page\n\n\n\n\nEdit page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear your history\n\nRecently Viewed\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IMDb AppGet the IMDb AppView Full SiteHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyInterest-Based Ads\u00a9 1990-2021 by IMDb.com, Inc.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Her father had committed suicide years ago which left a deep impact on her heart. Her family is dysfunctional since her mother and grandmother just cannot stop arguing. But when Aman (Shahrukh Khan) arrives next door, the whole gloomy conditions change. Aman infuses life in skeptical and overtly serious Naina, and she falls in love with him. But Aman knows that he cannot marry Naina because of a secret which he cannot divulge to her. So he intends upon setting her up with her best pal Rohit (Saif Ali Khan).\nWritten by\nSoumitra \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n homosexual overtones\n|\n gay joke\n|\n neighbor\n|\n reverse footage\n|\n fast motion sequence\n|\u00a0See All (45)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nA Story Of A Lifetime.......In A Heartbeat        \n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Drama\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    There is a song of the same name \"Kuch To Hua Hai\" in Singham Returns (2014) which does not have the same tune as this \"Kuch To Hua Hai\".

The film tries to make the viewer believe that the Toronto shots are, in fact, New York, but the architectural styles and obvious Toronto landmarks are completely different than those found in New York.

I watched it a few days ago and i still have the movie running through my head. It is so amazing that it has a lasting impression.Once again, Shah Rukh Khan steals the spotlight and does a magnificent performance as the beautiful and sweet Aman Mathur.By the way, i was thinking \"What a funny movie\" until the end...it just gets sad. And me being a really sensitive person, wow...it just blows you away. Shah Rukh Khan's brilliant performance will stay with you forever.I was up at 2.30 in the morning, tissues strewn all around me with tears just pouring down my face. The moment you try to stop crying, another scene comes on and you start again. Seriously, i'm really sensitive so no surprise but i reckon this film was the first film that actually made me cry that much. I just couldn't stop!! This is a must for everyone..including you sensitive people out there! Everyone must watch this film! It's just beautiful and it was actually an eye-opener for me! You've got to cherish whatever you have because who knows...tomorrow may never come.\n\n\n\n\n                90 of 94 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 149 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Skylar lives with a large extended family in Manhattan. Her parents, Bob and Steffi, have been married for many years. Joe, a friend of theirs, has a daughter, DJ, with Steffi. After yet another relationship, Joe is alone again. He flees to Venice, where he meets Von, and makes her believe that he is the man of her dreams. However, their happiness is fake all the way, and Von returns to her husband. Steffi spends her time in philanthropy, and manages to break up Skylar and Holden by introducing Skylar to ex-con Charles Ferry.\nWritten by\n<THURESON@HEM.PASSAGEN.SE> \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n lingerie slip\n|\n portrait\n|\n museum\n|\n new york city\n|\n halloween costume\n|\u00a0See All (108)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated R for one use of strong language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nJulia Roberts and Natalie Portman would go on to work together again in Closer (2004), which was released eight years later.

Some of the vocalizations are amateurish (Alan Alda is an exception) but Dick Hyman's musical arrangements and the performances of the musicians are fine. Alda's rendition of the old Cole Porter song \"Thinking of You\", accompanied by the marvelous Dick Hyman on the piano, is first rate.\nWoody Allen provides many hilarious moments. He uses the great violinist Itzhak Perlman as the punch line to a carefully constructed gag. He uses the invasion of privacy of a session of psychoanalysis as an offbeat plot device. He satirizes the romantic young and the do-gooding impulses of the old. He takes us from Manhattan to Venice and Paris. He involves us in old tunes and comically elaborate dance routines. He gives us a good time.Everyone Says I Love You is one of the very few movies I have ever gone back to the theater to see another time.  I even bought the tape.\n\n\n\n\n                60 of 75 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 140 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

In your typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy fights girl with swords plot, the story revolves around Mabel, the youngest of Maj. Gen. Stanley's many daughters, and Frederic, an ex-Pirate of Penzance. They fall in love and proceed to retrieve the Stanleys' fortune from the Pirates (stolen 20 years ago). The Pirate King informs Frederic that since he was a Leap Year baby born on February 29, Frederic is still technically the King's apprentice. Frederic must then decide between duty and honor--the only good qualities the King taught him- and true love.\nWritten by\nTodd Kogutt: SCAVENGER \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nPlot Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n kneed in the groin\n|\n woman with a gun\n|\n horseback riding\n|\n door\n|\n window\n|\u00a0See All (125)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nBuckle Your Swash and Jolly Your Roger for the Funniest Rock 'N Rollickin' Adventure Ever!                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Adventure\u00a0|\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Musical\u00a0|\n Romance\n\n\n\nCertificate:\n\n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\n    According to 'Allmovie', the story \"loosely follows the structure\" of the Pirates of Penzance operetta.

The lyrics were \"dumbed down\" (one example I remember: \"hypocritical\" substituted for \"sanctimonious\" in the \"Pirate King's Song\", the jokes were inane (I remember the collective audience groan when Frederick was told to \"use the force\" to recover the sword!) and the added songs were embarrassments (The contrived sexual innuendo of \"Pumping and Blowing\" was excruciating to watch!).Instead, I STRONGLY recommend you rent \"The Pirates of Penzance\", starring Kevin Kline and Linda Ronstadt.  It is a funny and fairly faithful adaptation of the Gilbert and Sullivan original. It is a MUCH BETTER movie. \"The Pirate Movie\" was a spoof of the operetta. There was really no reason to parody \"the Pirates of Penzance\" since it is hilarious in the first place. In this version, Kline steals the show as the \"Pirate King\". He is fabulously funny!!! Angela Lansbury's \"Ruth\" adds to the fun. Linda Rondstat shows off her versatile voice and gets into the silly spirit of Gilbert and Sullivan. Rex Smith, though not on a par with Kline, Lanxbury and Ronstadt, is an adequate Frederick (certainly better than Christopher Atkins in this mutt).Parodies of classics can be excellent.  This one wasn't.  Don't waste your time.\n\n\n\n\n                8 of 15 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 111 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

This is what Max experiences when he fools a gang of local toughs who cornered him at school. The gang finds out that the key he gave them is of no value in committing a robbery, and they chase him through the streets of his neighborhood, bent on revenge. He tries to escape by slipping into the open door of an old warehouse, but they follow him there, too. While running from them through aisles filled with all kinds of stuff, he bumps into an old boom box. By doing that, he manages to release Kazaam, a genie who has been held captive for thousands of years. In order to stay free, Kazaam must give Max three wishes.\nWritten by\nAnonymous \n\n\nPlot Summary\n|\nAdd Synopsis\n\n\n\nPlot Keywords:\n bathing\n|\n glass of water\n|\n rapping\n|\n wrecking ball\n|\n mother son relationship\n|\u00a0See All (71)\u00a0\u00bb\n\n\n\nTaglines:\nThe world's most powerful genie has just met his match.                \n See more\u00a0\u00bb\n                \n\n\n\nGenres:\n Comedy\u00a0|\n Family\u00a0|\n Fantasy\u00a0|\n Musical\n\n\n\nMotion Picture Rating\n                    (MPAA)\n                \nRated PG for action violence and language\n| \n See all certifications\u00a0\u00bb\n            \n\n\nParents Guide:\n\n View content advisory\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nJohn Costelloe plays a firefighter in this movie.

This \"movie\" was more of a torture device, kind of like the chinese water torture and such. there are 2 good things about this \"movie\" though.. the kid's snaggletooth was hilarious and whenever it's on disney, i turn it on and fall asleep to it.. works better than nyquil.. overall: my wish would be that this disgrace was never ever ever made.\n\n\n\n\n                5 of 10 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 108 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.

Their adventures include buying and sharing a wife, hijacking a stage, kidnaping six prostitutes, and turning their mining camp into a boomtown. Along the way there is plenty of drinking, gambling, and singing. They even find time to do some creative gold mining.\nWritten by\nDavid J.

It was not the huge box-office success that the producers had hoped it would be. Clint Eastwood's experiences on this movie inspired him to form his own production company, Malpaso, saying that working on this movie had shown him how not to make a movie.

The large (undershot) water wheel serves no purpose at all. Water wheels often were used to power stamp batteries (crushers) but since it is free gold in an alluvial deposit, there is no need for crushing. Also it unlikely that the water wheel was used to pump excavations dry as this would have been impossible given the proximity of the river and the permeability of the alluvials.

See more  \u00bb\n    \n\n\nAlternate Versions\nOn its release to what were then called \"neighborhood theatres\" (i.e. theatres which showed films that had ended their first runs downtown), the film's running time was shortened by having three songs eliminated, \"I Still See Elisa\", \"The First Thing You Know\", and \"Gold Fever\". This left both Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood with only one solo song each. The film was restored to its original length for its first television showing, and has remained that way ever since.

The fact that the leads (Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood and Jean Seberg) can't sing matters not a jot; they perform with charisma, (even Seberg is less wan than usual) and bring a touch of realism to the proceedings, their songs seeming to evolve naturally from the action. Other singing duties are performed by the splendid Harve Presnell and a rousing, mostly male, chorus for this is a musical western of a more robust kind than \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\". It's plot, which concerns mining for gold, polygamy and the building of a town, fairly races along. Logan handles the whole thing with great aplomb and brings to it some nice, naturalistic touches sadly lacking from his earlier musicals, \"South Pacific\" and \"Camelot\". Most critics didn't warm to it, though and it remains largely under-valued.\n\n\n\n\n                39 of 48 people found this review helpful.\u00a0\n                Was this review helpful to you?\n\n                    Yes\nNo\n                        | Report this\n\nReview this title\n|\nSee all 132 user reviews\u00a0\u00bb\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThis FAQ is empty.
