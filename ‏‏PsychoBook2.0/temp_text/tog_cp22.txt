the
reverberations
When

cut
her
bittings
finally
ground
and
sharpened
enough
that
she
can
connect
the
obelisks
and
make
them
sing

know
Those
who
hope

out
that
singer
are
forever
barred
from
turning
the
key
ourselves

the
night
Nassun
wakes
dark
the
barracks
still
she
careful
not
step
the
creakier
floorboards
she
pulls
her
shoes
and
jacket
and
makes
her
way
across
the
room
None
the
others
stirs
they
even
wake
and
notice
They
probably
just
think
she
has
the
outhouse
Outside
quiet
The
sky
beginning
lighten
with
dawn
the
east
though
harder
tell
now
that
the
ash
clouds
have
thickened
She
goes
the
top
the
downhill
path
and
notices
few
lights
Jekity
Some
the
farmers
and
fishers
are
Found
Moon
though
all
still
What
that
tugs
her
mind
The
feel
irritating
gummy
something
caught
her
hair
and
needs
yanked
free
The
sensation
centered
her
sessapinae
Deeper
This
tugs
the
light
her
spine
the
silver
between
her
cells
the
threads
that
bind
her
the
ground
and
Found
Moon
and
Schaffa
and
the
sapphire
that
hovers
just
above
the
clouds
Jekity
visible
now
and
again
when
the
clouds
break
little
The
irritation
north
Something
happening
north
Nassun
turns
follow
the
sensation
climbing
the
hill
the
crucible
mosaic
and
stopping
its
center
the
wind
makes
her
hair
puffs
shiver
here
she
can
see
the
forest
that
surrounds
Jekity
spread
before
her
like
map:
rounded
treetops
and
occasional
outcroppings
ribbon
basalt
Part
her
can
perceive
shifting
forces
reverberating
lines
connections
amplification
But
what
Why
Something
immense
cWhat
you
perceive
the
opening
the
Obelisk
Gate
says
Steel
She
unsurprised
find
him
suddenly
standing
beside
her
cMore
than
one
obelisk
Nassun
asks
because
that
what
she
sessing
Lots
more

one
stationed
above
this
half

continent

great
mechanism
beginning

again
they
were
meant
Steel
voice
baritone
and
surprisingly
pleasant
sounds
wistful
this
moment
Nassun
finds
herself
wondering
about
his
life
his
past
whether
has
ever
been
child
like
her
That
seems
impossible
cSo
much
power
The
very
heart
the
planet
channeled
through
the
Gate
and
she
uses
for
frivolous
purpose
faint
sigh
cThen
again
did
its
original
creators
suppose
Somehow
Nassun
knows
that
Steel
talking
about
her
mother
with
that
she
Mama
alive
and
angry
and
full
much
power
cWhat
purpose
Nassun
makes
herself
ask
Steel
eyes
slide
toward
her
She
has
not
specified
whose
purpose
she
means:
her
mother
those
ancient
people
who
first
created
and
deployed
the
obelisks
cThe
destruction
one
enemies
course
small
and
selfish
purpose
that
feels
great
the
moment
though
not
without
consequence
Nassun
considers
what
she
has
learned
and
sessed
and
seen
the
dead
smiles
the
other
two
Guardians
cFather
Earth
fought
back
she
says
cAs
one
does
against
those
who
seek
enslave
That
understandable
isn
Nassun
closes
her
eyes
Yes
all
understandable
really
when
she
thinks
about
The
way
the
world
isn
the
strong
devouring
the
weak
but
the
weak
deceiving
and
poisoning
and
whispering
the
ears
the
strong
until
they
become
weak
too
Then
all
broken
hands
and
silver
threads
woven
like
ropes
and
mothers
who
move
the
earth
destroy
their
enemies
but
cannot
save
one
little
boy
(Girl
There
has
never
been
anyone
save
Nassun
Her
mother
warned
her
there
never
would
Nassun
ever
wants
free
fear
she
has
choice
but
forge
that
freedom
for
herself
she
turns
slowly
face
her
father
who
stands
quietly
behind
her
cSweetening
says
the
voice
usually
uses
for
her
but
she
knows
isn
real
His
eyes
are
cold
the
ice
she
left
all
over
his
house
few
days
ago
His
jaw
tight
his
body
shaking
just
little
She
glances
down
his
tight
fist
There
knife
beautiful
one
made
from
red
opal
her
favorite
his
more
recent
work
has
slight
iridescence
and
smooth
sheen
that
completely
disguises
the
razor
sharpness
its
knapped
edges
cHi
Daddy
she
says
She
glances
toward
Steel
who
surely
aware
what
Jija
intends
But
the
gray
stone
eater
has
not
bothered
turn
away
from
the
predawn
forestscape
the
northern
sky
where
many
earth
changing
things
are
happening
Very
well
She
faces
her
father
again
cMama
alive
Daddy
the
words
mean
anything
him
doesn
show
just
keeps
standing
there
looking
her
Looking
her
eyes
particular
She
always
had
her
mother
eyes
Suddenly
doesn
matter
Nassun
sighs
and
rubs
her
face
with
her
hands
weary
Father
Earth
must
after
many
eternities
hate
Hate
tiring
Nihilism
easier
though
she
does
not
know
the
word
and
will
not
for
few
years
what
she
feeling
regardless:
overwhelming
sense
the
meaninglessness
all
think
understand
why
you
hate
she
says
her
father
she
drops
her
hands
her
sides
done
bad
things
Daddy
like
you
probably
thought
would
don
know
how
not
them
like
everybody
wants
bad
there
nothing
else
can
She
hesitates
then
says
what
been
her
mind
for
months
now
unspoken
She
doesn
think
she
have
another
chance
say
wish
you
could
love
anyway
even
though
bad
She
thinks
Schaffa
she
says
this
though
Schaffa
who
loves
her
matter
what
father
should
Jija
just
keeps
staring
her
Elsewhere
the
silence
that
plane
awareness
that
occupied
sesuna
and
whatever
the
sense
the
silver
threads
called
Nassun
feels
her
mother
collapse
specific
she
feels
her
mother
exertion
upon
the
shifting
glimmering
network
obelisks
suddenly
cease
Not
that
ever
touched
her
sapphire
sorry
Daddy
Nassun
says
last
tried
keep
loving
you
but
was
too
hard
much
bigger
than
her
Armed
where
she
not
When
moves
with
mountainous
lumber
all
shoulders
first
and
bulk
and
slow
buildup
unstoppable
speed
She
weighs
barely
hundred
pounds
She
has
real
chance
But
the
instant
that
she
feels
the
twitch
her
father
muscles
small
reverberating
shocks
against
the
ground
and
air
she
orients
her
awareness
toward
the
sky
single
ringing
command
The
transformation
the
sapphire
instantaneous
causes
concussion
air
that
rushes
inward
fill
the
vacuum
The
sound
this
makes
the
loudest
crack
thunder
Nassun
has
ever
heard
Jija
mid
lunge
starts
and
stumbles
looking
moment
later
the
sapphire
slams
into
the
ground
before
Nassun
cracking
the
central
stone
the
crucible
mosaic
and
six
foot
radius
ground
around
her
isn
the
sapphire
she
seen
till
now
although
the
sameness
transcends
things
like
shape
When
she
extends
her
hand
wrap
around
the
hilt
the
long
flickering
knife
blue
stone
she
falls
into
little
flowing
through
watery
facets
light
and
shadow
down
into
the
earth
Out
away
brushing
against
the
other
parts
the
whole
that
the
Gate
The
thing
her
hand
the
same
monstrous
mountainous
dynamo
silvery
power
that
has
always
been
The
same
tool
just
more
versatile
now
Jija
stares
then
her
There
instant
which
wavers
and
Nassun
waits
turns
runs
was
her
father
once
Does
remember
that
time
She
wants
him
Nothing
between
them
will
ever
the
same
again
but
she
wants
that
time
matter
Jija
comes
her
again
shouting
raises
the
knife
Nassun
lifts
the
sapphire
blade
from
the
earth
nearly
the
length
her
body
but
weighs
nothing
the
sapphire
floats
after
all
just
floating
here
front
her
instead
above
She
doesn
lift
either
strictly
speaking
She
wills
move
new
position
and
does
front
her
Between
her
and
Jija
that
when
Jija
angles
his
body
stab
her
cannot
help
bumping
right
into
This
makes
easy
inevitable
for
her
power
lay
into
him
She
doesn
kill
him
with
ice
Nassun
defaults
using
the
silver
instead
orogeny
most
days
The
shift
Jija
flesh
more
controlled
than
what
she
did
Eitz
largely
because
she
aware
what
she
doing
and
also
because
she
doing
purpose
Jija
begins
turn
stone
starting
the
point
contact
between
him
and
the
obelisk
What
Nassun
doesn
consider
momentum
which
carries
Jija
forward
even
glances
off
the
sapphire
and
twists
and
sees
what
happening
his
flesh
and
starts
inhale
for
scream
doesn
finish
the
inhalation
before
his
lungs
are
solidified
does
however
finish
his
lunge
though
off
balance
and
out
control
more
fall
than
attack
now
Still
fall
with
knife
its
focal
point
and
the
knife
catches
Nassun
the
shoulder
was
aiming
for
her
heart
The
pain
the
strike
sudden
and
terrible
and
breaks
Nassun
concentration
once
This
bad
because
the
sapphire
flares
her
pain
does
flickering
into
its
half
real
state
and
back
she
gasps
and
staggers
This
finishes
Jija
instant
solidifying
him
completely
into
statue
with
frizz
smoky
quartz
hair
and
round
red
ocher
face
and
clothes
deep
blue
serendibite
because
wore
dark
clothing
order
stalk
his
daughter
This
statue
stands
poised
for
only
instant
though
and
then
the
flicker
the
sapphire
sends
ripple
through
him
like
struck
bell
Not
unlike
the
concussion
turned
inward
orogenic
force
that
Guardian
once
inflicted
man
named
Innon
Jija
shatters
the
same
way
just
not
wetly
brittle
stuff
weak
poorly
made
The
pieces
him
tumble
into
stillness
around
Nassun
feet
Nassun
gazes
the
remains
her
father
for
long
aching
moment
Beyond
her
Found
Moon
and
down
below
Jekity
lights
are
coming
the
cabins
Everyone
been
woken
the
thunderclap
the
sapphire
There
confusion
voices
calling
back
and
forth
frantic
sessing
and
probes
the
earth
Steel
now
gazes
down
Jija
with
her
cIt
never
ends
says
cIt
never
gets
better
Nassun
says
nothing
Steel
words
fall
into
her
like
stone
into
water
and
she
does
not
ripple
their
wake
cYou
kill
everything
you
love
eventually
Your
mother
Schaffa
All
your
friends
here
Found
Moon
way
around
She
closes
her
eyes
cNo
way
except
one
careful
considered
pause
cShall
tell
you
that
way
Schaffa
coming
She
can
sess
him
the
buzz
him
the
constant
torment
the
thing
his
brain
that
will
not
let
her
remove
Schaffa
who
loves
her
You
kill
everything
you
love
eventually
cYes
she
makes
herself
say
cTell
how
not
She
trails
off
She
can
say
hurt
them
because
she
has
already
hurt
many
She
monster
But
there
must
way
for
her
monstrousness
contained
For
the
threat
orogene
existence
ended
cThe
Moon
coming
back
Nassun
was
lost
long
ago
flung
away
like
ball
paddle
string
but
the
string
has
drawn
back
Left
itself
will
pass
and
fly
off
again
done
that
before
several
times
now
She
can
see
one
her
father
eyes
set
into
chunk
his
face
gazing
her
from
amid
the
pile
His
eyes
were
green
and
now
they
have
become
beautiful
shade
clouded
peridot
cBut
with
the
Gate
you
can
nudge
Just
little
Adjust
its
tra
soft
amused
sound
cThe
path
that
the
Moon
naturally
follows
Instead
letting
pass
again
lost
and
wandering
bring
home
Father
Earth
been
missing
Bring
straight
here
and
let
them
have
reunion
She
understands
suddenly
why
Father
Earth
wants
her
dead
cIt
will
terrible
thing
Steel
says
softly
nearly
her
ear
because
moved
closer
her
cIt
will
end

Seasons
will
end
every
season
And
yet
what

feeling
right
now

will
ever
suffer
again
Nassun
turns

Steel
bent
toward

almost
comical
slyness
chiseled
his
face
Then
Schaffa
trots
stop
before
them
staring
the
ruin
Jija
and
she
sees
the
moment
when
the
realization
what
seeing
flickers
across
his
face
mobile
shockwave
His
icewhite
gaze
lifts
her
and
she
searches
his
expression
with
her
belly
clenched
against

pain
There
only
anguish
his
face
Fear
for
her
sorrow
her

alarm
her
bloodied
shoulder
Wariness
and
protective
anger
focuses
Steel
still
her
Schaffa
The
ache
Jija
fades
within
the
ease

Nassun

then
Steel
and
says
