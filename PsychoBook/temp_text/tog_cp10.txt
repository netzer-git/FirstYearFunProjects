CALLED
HIM
CRAZY
many
times
Told
yourself
that
you
despised
him
even
you
grew
love
him
Why
Perhaps
you
understood
early
that
was
what
you
could
become
More
likely
that
you
suspected
long
before
you
lost
and
found
him
again
that
wasn
crazy

You
obeyed
once
because
you
thought
would
make
you
safe
showed
you
again
and
again
unrelentingly
would
not
let
you
pretend
otherwise
that
obedience
did
not
make
one
safe
from
the
Guardians
the
nodes
the
lynchings
the
breeding
the
disrespect
then
what
was
the
point
The
game
was
too
rigged

playing
You
pretended
hate
him
because
you
were
coward
But
you
eventually
loved
him
and
part
you
now

not

you
now
over

possibly
because

Everything
about

anyway
Maybe
expecting
commentary
maybe
giving
you
time

his

just

something
you
can

about

more

Who

when
some
version
our

first
crawled
out

started

Thirty

Antimony
the
only
one
who
would
speak
first

they
were
deferring
her
but
then
realized
they
just
didn
speak
language
Some
them
weren
used
interacting
with
people
all
They
stared
and
sometimes
had
shoo

was

that
power
cSomething
went

got
the

even
Antimony
didn

exactly

are
still

about

Something
just
went

away

that

just
because

hurt
you
You
know
that
true
But
more

you
hear
the

cThe

and

individual

While

there
wondering

the
rust
control
cabochon
and
marveling
that
there
are
more

cAlabaster

flung

cInto

just

you
and

you

practically
shouting
You
throw
guilty
look
Alabaster
but

woken
Neither
has
the

When

Antimony
says
cThat

Almost
afterthought
she
adds
cAlabaster
made
the
first
two
necessary
course
corrections
the
Moon
slowing
and
altering
the
trajectory
that
would
have
taken
past
the
planet
again
Someone
else
must
make
the
second
correction
bringing
back
into
stable
orbit
and
magical
alignment
Should

reestablished

You
inhale

you
get
now
Give
Father
Earth
back
his
lost
child
and
perhaps
his
wrath
will
appeased
That
the
third
faction
then:
those
who
want
truce
people
and
Father
Earth
agreeing
tolerate
one
another
even
means
creating
the
Rift
and
killing
millions
the
process
Peaceful
coexistence

The

gaze
alien
abruptly
shifts
subtle

maybe
you
just

Suddenly
she

very
very
bitter
cAnd

frown
her

she
says
nothing
more
You
want
ask
more
questions

harder

but
she
was
right:
You
weren
ready
for
this
Your
head
spinning
and
the
words
stuffed
into
are
starting
blur
and
jumble
together
too
much
deal
with
Wants
and
needs
You
swallow
cCan
stay
here
She
does
not
respond
You
suppose
wasn
really
necessary
ask
You
get
and
move
the
nearest
cot
Its
head
against
the
wall
which
would
put
your
head
behind
Alabaster
and
Antimony
and
you
don
feel
like
staring

back

stone
eater
head
You
grab
the
pillow
and
curl
with
your
head
the
foot
the
bed
instead
you
can
see
Alabaster
face
Once
you
slept
better
when
you
could
see
him
across
the
expanse
Innon
shoulders
This
not
the

reassurance
but
something
After
while
Antimony
begins
sing
again
strangely
relaxing
You

better
than
you
