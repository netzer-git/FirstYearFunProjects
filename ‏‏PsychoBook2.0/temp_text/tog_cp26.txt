Nettie
Lonesome
had
two
things
the
world
that
were
worth
sweet
goddamn:
her
old
boots
and
her
one
eyed
mule
Blue
Neither
item
actually
belonged
her
But
then
again
nothing
did
Not
even
the
whisper
thin
blanket
she
lay
under
pretending
asleep
and
wishing
the
black
mare
would
get
out
the
water
trough
before
things
went
south
The
last
fourteen
years
Nettie
life
had
passed
shriveled
corner
Durango
territory
under
the
leaking
roof
this
wind
chapped
lean
with
Pap
and
Mam
not
quite
slave
and
nowhere
close
something
like
daughter
Their
faces
white
and
wobbling
new
butter
under
smear
prairie
dirt
held
kindness
The
boots
and
the
mule
had
belonged
Pap
right
until
the
day
exhausted
their
use
sentiment
threatened
apply
her
every
time
she
was
just
little
too
slow
with
the
porridge
cNettie
Girl
you
take
care
that
wild
filly
put
one
her
goddamn
skull
Pap
got
lather
when
been
drinking
which
was
pretty
much
always
least
this
time
his
anger
was
aimed
critter
instead
Nettie
When
the
witch
hearted
black
filly
had
first
shown
the
farm
Pap
had
laid
claim
and
pronounced
her
fine
chunk
flesh
and
sign
the
Creator
good
graces
Nettie
broke
her
and
sold
her
for
decent
price
she
closer
paying
back
Pap
for
taking
her
baby
when
nobody
else
had
wanted
her
but
the
hungry
circling
vultures
The
value
Pap
placed
feeding
and
housing
half
Injun
half
black
orphan
girl
always
seemed
instead
down
matter
that
Nettie
did
most
the
work
around
the
homestead
these
days
Maybe
that
was
why
she
not
been
taught
her
sums:
Then
she
know
her
own
damn
worth
the
penny
But
the
dainty
black
mare
outside
wouldn
roped
much
less
saddled
and
gentled
and
Nettie
had
failed
sell
her
the
cowpokes
the
Double
Ranch
next
door
Her
idol
Monty
was
top
hand
and
always
had
kind
word
But
even
had
put
boot
Pap
poorly
kept
fence
laughed
through
his
mustache
and
hollered
that
horse
that
couldn
caught
couldn
sold
matter
how
many
times
Pap
drove
the
filly
away
with
poorly
thrown
bottles
stones
and
bullets
the
critter
crept
back
under
cover
night
ruin
the
water
dancing
jig
the
trough
which
meant
another
blistering
trip
the
creek
with
leaky
bucket
for
Nettie
Splash
splash
Whinny
Could
horse
laugh
Nettie
figured
this
one
could
Pap
however
was
humorless
bastard
who
didn
get
joke
that
didn
involve
bruises
cUnless
you
wanna
live
the
flats
eatin
bugs
you
best
get
girl
Nettie
rolled
off
her
worn
out
straw
tick
hoping
there
weren
any
scorpions
centipedes
the
dusty
dirt
floor
the
moon
scant
light
she
shook
out
Pap
old
boots
and
shoved
her
bare
feet
into
the
cracked
leather
Splash
splash
The
shotgun
cocked
loud
enough
heard
across
the
border
and
Nettie
dove
into
Mam
old
wool
cloak
and
ran
toward
the
stockyard
with
her
long
thick
braids
slapping
against
her
back
Mam
said
nothing
just
rocked
her
chair
the
window
bottle
cradled
her
arm
like
baby
corpse
Grabbing
the
rawhide
whip
from
its
nail
the
warped
door
Nettie
hurried
past
Pap
the
porch
and
stumbled
across
the
yard
around
two
mostly
roofless
barns
and
toward
the
wet
black
shape
taunting
her
the
moonlight
against
backdrop
stars
cGet
mare
monster
flapping
jacket
with
waving
whip
would
send
any
horse
with
sense
wheeling
the
opposite
direction
but
this
horse
had
apparently
been
dancing
the
creek
the
day
sense
was
handed
out
The
mare
stood
the
water
trough
and
stared
Nettie
like
she
was
damn
strange
bird
her
dark
eyes
blinking
with
moonlight
and
her
lips
pulled
back
over
long
white
teeth
Nettie
slowed
She
wasn
one
quirt
horse
but
the
mare
kept
causing
ruckus
Pap
would
shoot
her
without
second
even
first
thought
and
wasn
deep
his
bottle
that
was
sure
miss
Getting
smacked
with
rawhide
had
better
than
getting
shot
the
head
Nettie
doubled
her
shouting
and
prepared
herself
for
the
heartache
that
would
accompany
the
smack
whip
unmarred
hide
She
didn
even
own
the
horse
much
less
the
right
beat
Nettie
had
grown
trying
the
opposite
Pap
and
hurting
something
that
didn
come
with
claws
and
stinger
went
against
her
grain
cShoo
fool
have
whip
you
she
said
creeping
closer
The
horse
didn
budge
and
for
the
millionth
time
Nettie
swung
the
whip
around
the
horse
neck
like
rope
all
gentle
like
But
ever
the
mare
tossed
her
head
exactly
the
right
moment
and
the
braided
leather
snickered
against
the
wooden
water
trough
instead
cGodamighty
why
won
you
move
Ain
nobody
wants
you
you
won
rode
bred
Dumb
mare
that
the
horse
reared
with
wild
scream
spraying
water
she
pawed
the
air
Before
Nettie
could
leap
back
avoid
the
splatter
the
mare
had
wheeled
and
galloped
into
the
night
The
starlight
showed
her
streaking
across
the
prairie
with
speed
Nettie
herself
would
enjoyed
especially
meant
she
could
turn
her
back
Pap
dirt
poor
farm
and
good
cattle
company
forever
Doubling
over
stare
her
scuffed
boots
while
she
caught
her
breath
Nettie
felt
her
hope
disappear
with
hoofbeats
the
night
low
and
painfully
unfamiliar
laugh
trembled
out
the
barn
shadow
and
Nettie
cocked
the
whip
back
that
was
ready
strike
cWho
that
Jed
But
wasn
Jed
the
mule
kicked
sometimes
stable
boy
and
she
already
knew
cLooks
like
that
black
mare
giving
you
spot
trouble
darlin
you
were
smart
you
set
fire
her
tail
figure
peeled
away
from
the
barn
jerky
thin
and
slithery
too
short
coat
with
buttons
that
glinted
like
extra
stars
The
man
hat
was
pulled
low
his
brown
hair
overshaggy
and
his
lily
white
hand
his
gun
manner
both
unfriendly
and
relaxed
that
Nettie
found
insulting
cYou
best
run
off
mister
Pap
don
like
strangers
his
land
especially
when
only
bottle
horses
you
want
ain
got
none
worth
selling
you
want
work
and
you
dumb
and
blind
best
come
back
the
morning
when
slept
off
the
mezcal
wouldn
work
for
that
good
for
nothing
piss
pot
even
needed
work
The
stranger
switched
sides
with
his
toothpick
and
looked
Nettie
and
down
like
horse
was
thinking
about
stealing
Her
fist
tightened
the
whip
handle
her
fingers
going
cold
She
wouldn
defend
Pap
his
land
his
sorry
excuses
for
cattle
but
she
defend
the
only
thing
other
than
Blue
that
mostly
belonged
her
Men
had
been
pawing
her
for
two
years
now
and
nobody
yet
come
close
reaching
her
soft
parts
not
even
Pap
cThen
you
best
move
mister
The
feller
spit
his
toothpick
out
the
ground
and
took
step
forward
all
quiet
like
because
wore
spurs
And
that
was
Nettie
first
clue
that
wasn
what
seemed
cNaw
stay
Pretty
little
thing
like
you
keep
company
That
was
Nettie
second
clue
Nobody
called
her
pretty
unless
they
wanted
something
She
looked
around
the
yard
but
all
she
saw
were
sand
chaparral
bone
dry
cow
patties
and
the
remains
fence
that
Pap
hadn
seen
fit
fix
Mam
was
surely
asleep
and
Pap
had
gone
inside
maybe
around
back
piss
was
just
the
stranger
and
her
And
the
whip
cBullshit
she
spit
cPut
down
that
whip
before
you
hurt
yourself
girl
cDon
reckon
will
The
stranger
stroked
his
pistol
and
started
circle
her
Nettie
shook
the
whip
out
behind
her
she
spun
place
face
him
and
hunched
over
crouch
stopped
circling
when
the
barn
yawned
behind
her
barely
shell
thing
but
darker
than
sin
the
corners
And
then
took
step
forward
his
silver
pistol
out
and
flashing
starlight
Against
her
will
she
took
step
back
Inch
inch
drove
her
into
the
barn
with
slow
easy
steps
Her
feet
rattled
the
big
boots
her
fingers
numb
around
the
whip
she
had
forgotten
how
use
cWhat
you
think
you
gonna
mister
came
out
breathless
god
damn
her
tongue
His
mouth
turned
like
cat
the
sun
cSomething
nice
Something
somebody
probably
done
you
already
Your
master
pappy
maybe
She
pushed
air
out
through
her
nose
like
bull
cAin
got
pappy
master
cThen
guess
nobody
mind
will
they
That
was
pretty
much
for
Nettie
Lonesome
She
spun
her
heel
and
ran
into
the
barn
right
where
been
pushing
her
But
she
didn
flop
down
the
hay
toss
down
the
mangy
blanket
that
had
dried
into
folds
the
broke
down
three
wheeled
rig
she
snatched
the
sickle
from
the
wall
and
spun
face
him
under
the
hole
the
roof
Starlight
fell
down
her
ink
black
braids
and
glinted
off
the
parts
the
curved
blade
that
weren
rusted
reckon
mind
she
said
Nettie
wasn
little
thing
least
not
height
wise
and
she
figured
that
seeing
pissed
off
woman
with
weapon
each
hand
would
enough
drive
off
the
curious
feller
and
send
him
back
the
whores
the
Leaping
Lizard
where
apparently
belonged
But
the
stranger
just
laughed
and
cracked
his
knuckles
like
was
glad
for
fight
and
would
take
his
pleasure
with
his
fists
instead
his
twig
cYou
wanna
play
first
girl
Have
your
fun
You
think
you
facin
down
coydog
but
you
found
timber
wolf
stepped
into
the
barn
the
stranger
went
into
shadow
for
just
second
and
that
was
when
Nettie
struck
Her
whip
whistled
for
his
feet
and
managed
catch
one
ankle
yanking
hard
enough
pluck
him
off
his
feet
and
onto
the
back
his
fancy
jacket
puff
dust
went
thumped
the
ground
but
just
crossed
his
ankles
and
stared
her
and
laughed
Which
pissed
her
off
more
Dropping
the
whip
handle
Nettie
took
the
sickle
both
hands
and
went
for
the
stranger
legs
hoping
that
good
slash
would
keep
him
from
chasing
her
but
not
get
her
sent
the
hangman
noose
But
her
blade
whistled
over
patch
nothing
The
man
was
gone
her
whip
with
him
Nettie
stepped
into
the
doorway
watch
him
run
away
her
heart
thumping
underneath
the
tight
muslin
binding
she
always
wore
over
her
chest
She
squinted
into
the
long
flat
night
one
hand
the
hinge
what
used
barn
door
back
before
the
church
was
willing
pay
cash
money
for
Pap
old
lumber
But
the
stranger
wasn
hightailing
across
the
prairie
Which
meant
cLooking
for
someone
darlin
She
spun
sickle
hand
and
sliced
into
something
that
felt
like
ham
with
the
round
part
the
blade
Hot
blood
spattered
over
her
burning
like
lye
cGoddammit
girl
What
you
that
for
She
ripped
the
sickle
out
with
sick
splash
but
the
man
wasn
standing
the
barn
much
less
falling
the
floor
was
hanging
upside
down
from
cross
beam
cradling
his
arm
made
goddamn
sense
and
Nettie
couldn
stand
thing
that
made
sense
she
struck
again
while
was
poking
around
his
wound
This
time
she
caught
him
the
neck
This
time
fell
The
stranger
landed
the
dirt
and
popped
right
back
into
crouch
The
slice
his
neck
looked
like
the
first
carving
undercooked
roast
but
the
blood
was
slurry
and
smelled
like
rotten
meat
And
the
stranger
was
sneering
her
cGirl
you
just
made
the
biggest
mistake
your
short
useless
life
Then
sprang
her
There
was
way
should
been
able
jump
her
like
that
with
those
wounds
and
she
brought
her
hands
straight
without
thinking
Luckily
her
fist
still
held
the
sickle
and
the
stranger
took
right
the
face
the
point
the
blade
jerking
into
his
eyeball
with
moist
squish
Nettie
turned
away
and
lost
most
last
night
meager
dinner
noisy
splatter
against
the
wall
the
barn
When
she
spun
back
around
she
was
surprised
find
that
the
fool
hadn
fallen
died
done
anything
helpful
her
cause
Without
word
calmly
pulled
the
blade
out
his
eye
and
wiped
dribble
black
glop
off
his
cheek
His
smile
was
cold
dark
thing
that
sent
Nettie
feet
toward
Pap
and
the
crooked
house
and
anything
but
the
stranger
who
wouldn
die
wouldn
scream
and
wouldn
leave
her
alone
She
never
felt
safe
day
her
life
but
now
she
recognized
the
chill
hand
death
reaching
for
her
Her
feet
trembled
the
too
big
boots
she
stumbled
backward
across
the
bumpy
yard
tripping
stones
and
bits
trash
Turning
her
back
the
demon
man
seemed
intolerably
stupid
She
just
had
get
past
the
round
pen
and
then
she
halfway
the
house
Pap
wouldn
worth
much
now
but
had
gun
his
side
Maybe
the
stranger
would
give
saw
man
instead
just
half
breed
girl
nobody
cared
about
Nettie
turned
run
and
tripped
fallen
chunk
fence
going
down
hard
hands
and
skinned
knees
When
she
looked
she
saw
butternut
brown
pants
stippled
with
blood
and
spur
boots
tapping
cPap
she
shouted
cPap
help
She
was
gulping
big
breath
holler
again
when
the
stranger
boot
caught
her
right
under
the
ribs
and
knocked
all
back
out
The
force
the
kick
flipped
her
over
onto
her
back
and
she
scrabbled
away
from
the
stranger
and
toward
the
ramshackle
round
pen
old
gray
branches
and
junk
roped
together
just
barely
enough
fence
trick
colt
into
staying
put
They
slaughtered
pig
here
once
and
now
Nettie
knew
how
felt
soon
her
back
fetched
against
the
pen
the
stranger
crouched
front
her
one
eye
closed
and
weeping
black
and
the
other
brim
full
with
evil
over
the
bloody
slice
his
neck
looked
like
dead
man
corpse
groom
and
Nettie
was
pretty
sure
she
was
the
hell
Mam
kept
threatening
her
with
cAin
nobody
coming
Ain
nobody
cares
about
girl
like
you
Ain
nobody
gonna
need
not
after
what
you
done
The
stranger
leaned
down
and
made
like
was
going
kiss
her
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
Nettie
did
the
only
thing
that
came
mind
She
grabbed
stout
twig
from
the
wall
the
pen
and
stabbed
him
the
chest
hard
she
damn
could
She
expected
the
stick
break
against
his
shirt
like
the
time
she
seen
buggy
bash
apart
against
the
general
store
during
twister
But
the
twig
sunk
right
like
hot
knife
butter
The
stranger
shuddered
and
fell
her
his
mouth
working
gloppy
red
black
liquid
bubbled
out
She
didn
trust
blood
anymore
not
after
the
first
splat
had
burned
her
and
she
wasn
much
for
being
found
under
corpse
Nettie
shoved
him
off
hard
and
shot
her
feet
blowing
air
hard
galloping
horse
The
stranger
was
rolling
around
the
ground
plucking
his
chest
Thick
clouds
blotted
out
the
meager
starlight
and
she
had
nothing
like
the
view
she
have
tomorrow
under
the
white
hot
unrelenting
sun
But
even
girl
who
never
killed
man
before
knew
when
something
was
wrong
She
kicked
him
over
with
the
toe
her
boot
tit
for
tat
and
was
light
tumbleweed
when
landed
his
back
The
twig
jutted
out
black
splotch
his
shirt
and
the
slice
his
neck
had
curled
over
like
gone
meat
His
bad
eye
was
swamp
black
but
then
everything
was
black
midnight
His
mouth
was
open
the
lips
drawing
back
over
too
white
teeth
several
which
looked
like
they
come
out
panther
wasn
breathing
and
Pap
wasn
coming
and
Nettie
finger
reached
out
had
mind
its
own
and
flicked
one
big
shiny
curved
tooth
The
goddamn
thing
fell
back
into
the
dead
man
gaping
throat
Nettie
jumped
away
skitty
the
black
filly
and
her
boot
toe
brushed
the
dead
man
shoulder
and
his
entire
body
collapsed
itself
like
puffball
thousands
sparkly
motes
piling
the
place
occupied
and
spilling
out
through
his
empty
clothes
Utterly
bewildered
she
knelt
and
brushed
the
pile
with
trembling
fingers
was
sand
Nothing
but
sand
soft
wind
came
just
then
and
blew
some
the
stranger
away
revealing
one
those
big
curved
teeth
where
his
head
had
been
didn
make
goddamn
lick
sense
but
could
gone
far
worse
Still
wary
she
stood
and
shook
out
his
clothes
noting
that
everything
was
better
than
fine
condition
except
for
his
white
shirt
which
had
twig
sized
hole
the
breast
surrounded
smear
black
She
knew
enough
laundering
and
sewing
make
nice
enough
and
the
black
blood
his
pants
looked
her
eye
manly
and
tough
Even
the
stranger
boots
were
better
quality
than
any
that
had
ever
set
foot
Pap
land
snakeskin
with
fancy
chasing
With
her
own
too
big
boots
she
smeared
the
sand
back
into
the
hard
dry
ground
the
stranger
had
never
existed
All
that
was
left
were
the
four
big
panther
teeth
and
she
put
those
her
pocket
and
tried
forget
about
them
After
checking
the
yard
for
anything
livelier
than
scorpion
she
rolled
the
clothes
around
the
boots
and
hid
them
the
old
rig
the
barn
Knowing
Pap
would
pester
her
she
left
signs
scuffle
she
wiped
the
black
glop
off
the
sickle
and
hung
along
with
the
whip
out
Pap
drunken
reach
She
didn
need
any
more
whip
scars
her
back
than
she
already
had
Out
the
round
pen
the
sand
that
had
once
been
devil
stranger
had
all
blown
away
There
was
sign
what
had
almost
happened
just
few
more
deadwood
twigs
pulled
from
the
lopsided
fence
good
days
Nettie
spent
fair
bit
time
doing
the
dangerous
work
breaking
colts
doctoring
cattle
here
for
Pap
then
picking
the
twigs
that
got
knocked
off
and
roping
them
back
with
whatever
twine
she
could
scavenge
from
the
town
Wood
wasn
cheap
and
there
wasn
much
But
Nettie
hands
were
twitchy
still
and
she
picked
the
black
splattered
stick
and
wove
back
into
the
fence
wishing
she
lived
world
where
her
life
was
worth
more
than
mule
more
than
boots
more
than
stranger
cold
smile
the
barn
She
had
her
first
victory
but
one
would
ever
believe
her
and
they
did
she
wouldn
cheered
She
hanged
That
stranger
had
been
all
kinds
wrong
And
the
way
that
wanted
touch
her
that
felt
wrong
too
Nettie
couldn
recall
being
touched
kindness
not
all
her
years
with
Pap
and
Mam
Maybe
that
was
why
she
understood
horses
Mustangs
were
wild
things
captured
thoughtless
men
roped
and
branded
and
beaten
until
their
heads
hung
low
until
took
spurs
and
whips
move
them
rage
and
fear
But
Nettie
could
feel
the
wildness
inside
their
hearts
beating
under
skin
that
quivered
under
the
flat
her
palm
She
didn
break
horse
she
gentled
And
until
someone
touched
her
with
that
same
kindness
she
would
continue
shy
away
bare
her
teeth
and
lower
her
head
Someone
surely
had
been
kind
her
once
long
ago
She
could
feel
her
bones
But
Pap
said
she
been
tossed
out
like
trash
left
the
prairie
die
Which
she
almost
had
tonight
Again
Pap
and
Mam
were
asleep
the
porch
snoring
loud
thunder
When
Nettie
crept
past
them
and
into
the
house
she
had
four
shiny
teeth
one
fist
wad
cash
from
the
stranger
pocket
and
more
questions
than
there
were
stars
