GAIN

THIS
SPECULATION
You
know
Nassun
and
she
part
you
but
you
cannot
Nassun
and
think
have
established
now
that
you
not
know
her
well
you
think
(Ah
but
parent
does
with
any
child
Another
has
the
task
encompassing
Nassun
existence
But
you
love
her
and
that
means
that
some
part
cannot
help
but
the
same
love
then
shall
seek

space
break
With
her
consciousness
anchored
deep
within
the
earth
Nassun
listens
first
there
only
the
usual
impingement
upon
the
ambient
sesuna:
the
minute
flex
and
contract
strata
the
relatively
placid
churn
the
old
volcano
beneath
Jekity
the
slow
unending
grind
columnar
basalt
rising
and
cooling
into
patterns
She
gotten
used
this
She
likes
that
she
can
listen
this
freely
now
whenever
she
wants
instead
having
wait
until
the
dark
night
lying
awake
after
her
parents
have
gone
bed
Here
Found
Moon
Schaffa
has
given
Nassun
permission
use
the
crucible
whenever
she
wants
for
long
she
wants
She
tries
not
monopolize
because
the
others
need
learn
too
but
they
not
enjoy
orogeny
much
she
does
Most
them
seem
indifferent
the
power
they
wield
the
wonders
they
can
explore
mastering
few
the
others
are
even
afraid
which
makes
sense
Nassun
but
then
also
makes
sense
her
now
that
once
she
wanted
lorist
Now
she
has
the
freedom
fully
who
and
what
she
and
she
longer
fears
that
self
Now
she
has
someone
who
believes
her
trusts
her
fights
for
her
she
she
will
what
she
now
Nassun
rides
eddy
within
the
Jekity
hot
spot
balancing
perfectly
amid
the
conflicting
pressures
and
does
not
occur
her
afraid
She
does
not
realize
this
something
Fulcrum
four
ringer
would
struggle
But
then
she
doesn
the
way
four
ringer
would
taking
hold
the
motion
and
the
heat
and
trying
channel
both
through
herself
She
reaches
yes
but
just
with
her
senses
and
not
her
absorption
torus
But
where
Fulcrum
instructor
would
warn
that
she
can
affect
anything
like
this
she
follows
the
lesson
her
own
instincts
which
say
she
can
settling
into
the
eddy
swirling
with
she
can
relax
enough
winnow
down
through
its
friction
and
pressure
what
lies
beneath:
the
silver
This
the
word
she
has
decided
give
after
questioning
Schaffa
and
the
others
and
realizing
they
don
know
what
either
The
other
orogene
kids
can
even
detect
Eitz
thought
sessed
something
once
when
she
shyly
asked
him
concentrate
Schaffa
instead
the
earth
because
the
silver
easier
see
more
concentrated
more
potent
more
intent
within
people
than
the
ground
But
Schaffa
stiffened
and
glared
him
the
next
instant
and
Eitz
flinched
and
looked
guiltier
and
more
haunted
than
ever
Nassun
felt
bad
that
she
hurt
him
She
never
asked
him
try
again
The
others
however
can
even
that
much
the
other
two
Guardians
Nida
and
Umber
who
help
the
most
cThis
thing
that
culled
for
the
Fulcrum
when
found
when
they
heard
the
call
when
they
listened
too
closely
Nida
begins
and
Nassun
braces
herself
because
once
Nida
gets
started
there
telling
how
long
she
run
She
stops
only
for
the
other
Guardians
cThe
use
sublimates
lieu
controlling
structures
dangerous
determinate
warning
Important
cultivate
for
research
purposes
but
most
such
children
steered
into
node
service
Among
the
others
cut
cut
cut
them
for
was
forbidden
reach
for
the
sky
Amazingly
she
shuts
after
this
Nassun
wonders
what
the
sky
has
with
anything
but
she
knows
better
than
ask
lest
Nida
get
going
again
But
Umber
who
slow
and
quiet
Nida
fast
nods
cWe
allowed
few
progress
translates
cFor
breeding
For
curiosity
For
the
Fulcrum
pride
more
than
that
Which
tells
Nassun
several
things
once
she
sifts
sense
from
the
babble
Nida
and
Umber
and
Schaffa
are
not
proper
Guardians
anymore
though
they
used
They
have
given
the
credo
their
order
chosen
betray
the
old
ways
the
use
the
silver
clearly
issue
violent
concern
ordinary
Guardians
but
why
only
few
the
Fulcrum
orogenes
were
allowed
develop
the
skill
cprogress
what
was
the
danger
too
many
did
And
why
these
Guardians
who
once
cculled
for
the
skill
allow
her
unfettered
now
Schaffa
there
for
this
conversation
she
notes
but
does
not
speak
merely
watches
her
smiling
and
twitching
now
and
again
the
silver
sparks
and
tugs
within
him
That
been
happening
him
lot
lately
Nassun
isn
sure
why
Nassun
goes
home
the
evenings
after
her
days
Found
Moon
Jija
has
settled
into
his
Jekity
house
and
every
time
she
comes
back
there
are
new
touches
hominess
that
she
likes:
surprisingly
rich
blue
paint
the
old
wooden
door
cuttings
planted
the
small
housegreen
though
they
grow
scraggly
the
ash
thickens
the
sky
overhead
rug
has
bartered
glassknife
for
the
small
room
that
designates
her
own
not
big
the
room
she
had
back
Tirimo
but
has
window
that
overlooks
the
forest
around
Jekity
plateau
Beyond
the
forest
the
air
clear
enough
she
can
sometimes
see
the
coast
distant
line
white
just
beyond
the
forest
green
Beyond
that
spread
blue
that
fascinates
her
though
there
nothing
see
but
that
slice
color
from
here
She
has
never
seen
the
sea
close
and
Eitz
tells
her
wonderful
stories
it:
that
smells
salt
and
strange
life
that
washes
onto
thin
stuff
called
sand
which
little
grows
because
the
salt
that
sometimes
its
creatures
wiggle
bubble
forth
like
crabs
squid
sandteethers
though
the
lattermost
are
said
appear
only
during
Season
There
the
constant
danger
tsunami
which
why
one
lives
near
the
sea
they
can
avoid
and
indeed
few
days
after
Nassun
and
Jija
reach
Jekity
she
sessed
rather
than
saw
the
remnant
big
shake
far
the
east
well
out
sea
She
sessed
too
the
reverberations
this
caused
when
something
vast
shifted
and
then
pounded
the
land
along
the
coast
For
once
she
was
glad
far
away
Still
nice
having
home
again
Life
begins
feel
normal
for
the
first
time
very
long
while
One
evening
during
dinner
Nassun
tells
her
father
what
Eitz
has
said
about
the
sea
looks
skeptical
then
asks
where
she
heard
these
things
She
tells
him
about
Eitz
and
grows
very
quiet
cThis
rogga
boy
says
after
moment
Nassun
whose
instincts
have
finally
pinged
warning
she
gotten
out
the
habit
keeping
vigilant
for
Jija
mood
shifts
falls
silent
But
because
will
get
angrier
she
doesn
speak
she
finally
nods
cWhich
one
Nassun
bites
her
lip
Eitz
Schaffa
though
and
she
knows
that
Schaffa
will
allow
none
his
orogenes
come
harm
she
says
cThe
oldest
tall
and
very
black
and
has
long
face
Jija
keeps
eating
but
Nassun
watches
the
flex
muscles
his
jaw
that
have
nothing
with
chewing
cThat
Coaster
boy
seen
him
don
want
you
talking
him
anymore
Nassun
swallows
and
risks
have
talk
with
all
the
others
Daddy
how
learn
cLearn
Jija
looks
banked
contained
but
furious
cThat
boy
what
twenty
Twenty
five
And
still
rogga
Still
should
have
been
able
cure
himself
now
For
moment
Nassun
confused
because
curing
herself
orogeny
the
last
thing
she
thinks
the
end
her
lessons
Well
Schaffa
did
say
that
was
possible
and
Eitz
who
only
eighteen
but
obviously
aged
Jija
head
too
old
have
not
utilized
this
cure
going
With
chill
Nassun
realizes:
Jija
has
begun
doubt
Schaffa
claims
that
the
erasure
orogeny
possible
What
will
realizes
Nassun
longer
wants
cured
Nothing
good
cYes
Daddy
she
says
This
mollifies
him
usually
does
cIf
you
have
talk
him
during
your
lessons
fine
don
want
you
making
the
Guardians
angry
But
don
talk
him
outside
that
sighs
don
like
that
you
spend
much
time
there
grumbles
about
for
the
rest
the
meal
but
says
nothing
worse
eventually
Nassun
relaxes
The
next
morning
Found
Moon
she
says
Schaffa
need
learn
how
hide
what
better
Schaffa
carrying
two
satchels
uphill
the
Found
Moon
compound
she
says
this
They
heavy
and
freakishly
strong
but
even
has
breathe
hard
this
she
does
not
pester
him
for
response
while
walks
When
has
reached
one
the
compound
tiny
storeshacks
sets
the
satchels
down
and
catches
his
breath
easier
keep
goods
here
for
things
like
the
children
meals
than
back
and
forth
the
Jekity
storecaches
communal
mealhouse
cAre
you
safe
asks
then
quietly
This
why
she
loves
him
She
nods
biting
her
bottom
lip
because
wrong
that
she
must
wonder
this
about
her
own
father
looks
her
for
long
hard
moment
and
there
cold
consideration
this
look
that
warns
her
begun
think
simple
solution
her
problem
cDon
she
blurts
lifts
eyebrow
cDon
challenges
Nassun
has
lived
year
ugliness
Schaffa
least
clean
and
uncomplicated
his
brutality
This
makes
easy
for
her
set
her
jaw
and
lift
her
chin
cDon
kill
father
smiles
but
his
eyes
are
still
cold
cSomething
causes
fear
like
that
Nassun
Something
that
has
nothing
with
you
your
brother
your
mother
lies
Whatever
has
left
its
wound
your
father
wound
that
obviously
has
festered
will
lash
out
anything
that
touches
upon
even
near
that
reeking
old
sore
you
have
seen
She
thinks
Uche
and
nods
cThat
cannot
reasoned
with
can
she
blurts
done
before
know
how
manipulate
him
those
are
the
words
for
but
she
barely
ten
years
old
she
actually
says
can
stop
him
from
doing
anything
bad
always
have
before
Mostly
cUntil
you
fail
stop
him
once
That
would
enough
eyes
her
will
kill
him
ever
hurts
you
Nassun
Keep
that
mind
you
value
your
father
life
more
than
your
own
not
Then
turns
back
the
shed
arrange
the
satchels
and
that
the
end
the
conversation
Some
while
later
Nassun
tells
the
others
this
exchange
Little
Paido
suggests:
cMaybe
you
should
move
into
Found
Moon
with
the
rest
Ynegen
Shirk
and
Lashar
are
sitting
nearby
relaxing
and
recovering
after
afternoon
spent
finding
and
pushing
around
the
marked
rocks
buried
beneath
the
crucible
floor
They
nod
and
murmur
agreement
with
this
cIt
only
right
says
Lashar
her
haughty
way
cYou
never
truly
one
you
continue
living
down
there
among
them
Nassun
has
thought
this
herself
often
But
cHe
father
she
says
spreading
her
hands
This
elicits
understanding
from
the
others
and
few
looks
pity
Many
them
still
bear
the
marks
violence
inflicted
the
trusted
adults
their
lives
cHe
still
Shirk
snaps
back
and
that
the
end
the
matter
far
most
them
are
concerned
Eventually
Nassun
gives
trying
convince
them
otherwise
These
thoughts
invariably
begin
affect
her
orogeny
How
can
they
not
when
unspoken
part
her
wants
please
her
father
takes
all
herself
and
the
confidence
that
comes
delight
engage
with
the
earth
her
fullest
And
that
afternoon
when
she
tries
touch
the
spinning
silver
threads
the
hot
spot
and
goes
horribly
wrong
that
she
gasps
and
claws
her
way
back
awareness
only
find
that
she
has
iced
all
ten
rings
the
crucible
Schaffa
puts
his
foot
down
cYou
will
sleep
here
tonight
says
after
walking
across
the
crusted
earth
carry
her
back
bench
She
too
exhausted
walk
took
everything
she
had
not
die
cTomorrow
when
you
wake
going
with
you
your
house
and
bring
back
your
belongings
don
want
she
pants
even
though
she
knows
Schaffa
doesn
like
when
the
children
say
him
don
care
what
you
want
little
one
This
interfering
with
your
training
why
the
Fulcrum
took
children
from
their
families
What
you
too
dangerous
allow
any
distractions
however
beloved
cBut
She
does
not
have
the
strength
object
more
strongly
holds
her
his
lap
trying
warm
her
because
the
edge
her
own
torus
was
barely
inch
from
her
skin
Schaffa
sighs
For
while
says
nothing
except
shout
for
someone
bring
blanket
Eitz
the
one
who
delivers
having
already
gone
fetch
once
saw
what
happened
(Everyone
saw
what
happened
embarrassing
you
realized
back
during
Nassun
dangerous
early
childhood
she
very
very
proud
girl
Nassun
finally
stops
shivering
and
feeling
though
her
sessapinae
have
been
methodically
beaten
Schaffa
finally
says
cYou
serve
higher
purpose
little
one
Not
any
single
man
desire
not
even
mine
You
were
not
made
for
such
petty
things
She
frowns
cWhat
what
was
made
for
then
shakes
his
head
The
silver
flashes
through
him
the
webwork
alive
and
shifting
the
thing
lodged
his
sessapinae
weaves
its
will
again
tries
cTo
remedy
great
mistake
One
which
once
contributed
This
too
interesting
fall
asleep
though
Nassun
whole
body
craves
cWhat
was
the
mistake
cTo
enslave
your
kind
When
Nassun
sits
back
frown
him
smiles
again
but
this
time
sad
cOr
perhaps
more
accurate
say
that
perpetuated
their
enslavement
themselves
under
Old
Sanze
The
Fulcrum
was
nominally
run
orogenes
you
see
orogenes
whom
had
culled
and
cultivated
shaped
and
chosen
carefully
that
they
would
obey
that
they
knew
their
place
Given
choice
between
death
and
the
barest
possibility
acceptance
they
were
desperate
and
used
that
made
them
desperate
For
some
reason
pauses
here
sighs
Takes
deep
breath
Lets
out
Smiles
This
how
Nassun
knows
without
sessing
that
the
pain
which
lives
always
Schaffa
head
has
begun
flare
hotter
again
cAnd
kind
Guardians
such
once
was
were
complicit
this
atrocity
You
seen
how
your
father
knaps
stone
Hammering
flaking
away
its
weaker
bits
Breaking
cannot
bear
the
pressure
and
starting
over
with
another
That
what
did
back
then
but
with
children
Nassun
finds
this
hard
believe
course
Schaffa
ruthless
and
violent
but
that
his
enemies
year
commless
has
taught
Nassun
the
necessity
cruelty
But
with
the
children
Found
Moon
very
gentle
and
kind
cEven
she
blurts
not
the
clearest
questions
but
understands
what
she
means:
you
had
found
back
then
touches
her
head
smooths
hand
over
rests
his
fingertips
against
the
nape
her
neck
takes
nothing
from
her
this
time
but
perhaps
the
gesture
comforts
him
for
looks
sad
cEven
you
Nassun
hurt
many
children
back
then
sad
Nassun
decides
would
not
have
meant
back
then
even
done
something
bad
cIt
was
wrong
treat
your
kind
You
people
What
did
making
tools
you
was
wrong
allies
that
need
more
than
ever
now
these
darkening
days
Nassun
will
anything
that
Schaffa
asks
But
allies
are
needed
for
specific
tasks
and
they
are
not
the
same
thing
friends
The
ability
distinguish
this
also
something
the
road
has
taught
her
cWhat
you
need
allies
for
His
gaze
grows
distant
and
troubled
cTo
repair
something
long
broken
little
one
and
settle
feud
whose
origins
lie
far
our
past
that
most
have
forgotten
how
began
that
the
feud
continues
lifts
hand
and
touches
the
back
his
head
cWhen
gave
old
ways
pledged
myself
the
cause
helping
end
that
don
like
that
hurts
you
Nassun
says
staring
that
blot
the
silver
map
him
tiny
Smaller
than
one
the
needles
her
father
sometimes
uses
stitch
holes
clothing
Yet
negative
space
against
the
glimmer
perceptible
silhouette
only
its
effects
rather
than
itself
Like
the
motionless
spider
quivering
dew
laden
web
heart
Spiders
hibernate
though
during
Season
and
the
thing
within
Schaffa
never
stops
tormenting
him
cWhy
does
hurt
you
you
doing
what
wants
Schaffa
blinks
Squeezes
her
gently
and
smiles
cBecause
will
not
force
you
what
wants
present
its
wishes
you
choice
and
will
abide
you
say
less
trusting
your
kind
Admittedly
for
good
reason
shakes
his
head
cWe
can
speak
this
later
Now
let
your
sessapinae
rest
She
subsides
once
though
she
had
not
really
meant
sess
him
and
hadn
been
really
aware
doing
Constant
sessing

nature
her
nap
will
help
you
think
carries
her
into
one
the
dormitory
buildings
and
lays
her
down
unclaimed
cot
She
curls
within
the
cocooning
blanket
and
drifts
off
the
sound
his
voice
instructing
the
other
children
not
trouble
her
And
she
wakes
the
next
morning
the
echo
her
own
screams
and
strangled
gasps
she
fights
her
way
out
the
blanket
Someone
grabs
her
arm
and
everything
should
not
be:
not
now
not
her
not
who
she
wants
not
tolerable
She
flails
toward
the
earth
and
not

That
scream
echoes
across
the
land
not
just
threads
but
waves
not
just
through
the
land
but
through
water
and
air
and
and
then
and
then
something
answers
her
Something
the

She
does
not

what
she
does
Eitz
certainly
does
not

from
the
nightmare

She
sweet
kid
And
even
though
Eitz
longer

and
has
occurred
him
the
years
since
they
left
his
Coastal
home
that
Schaffa
smiled
too
much
that
day
and
smelled
faintly
blood
understands
what
means
that
Schaffa
taken
with
Nassun
The
Guardian
has
been
looking
for
something
all
this
time
and
spite
everything
Eitz
loves
him
enough
hope
that
finds
Perhaps
that
will
comfort
you
will
not
Nassun
when
her
frightened
disoriented

she
turns
Eitz
stone
This

the
thing
happening
far
away
and
underground
Alabaster
That
slower
crueler
yet
much
more
refined
Artful
What
hits
Eitz
catastrophe:
hammer
blow
disordered
atoms
reordered
not
quite
random
The
lattice
that
should
naturally
form
dissolves
into
chaos
starts
his
chest
when
Nassun
hand
tries
slap
him
away
and
spreads

over

into

though
one
will
see
the
ruby
inside
unless
they
break
him
Eitz
dies
almost
instantly
his

solidifying
first
into

quartz
and
deep
garnet
and

with
faint

beautiful
failure
happens
fast
that
has
time
for
fear
That
may
comfort
Nassun
later
nothing
else
But
the
moment
the
pent
seconds
after
this
happens
Nassun
writhes
and
tries
drag
her
mind
back
from
falling
falling
upward
through
watery
blue
light
and
Deshati
gasp
turns
into
scream
(which
sets
off
others
and
Peek
comes
forward
stare
openmouthed
the
glossy
brightly
colored
facsimile
himself
that
Eitz
has
become
number
things
happen
simultaneously
elsewhere
Some
these
things
you
will
have
guessed
Perhaps
hundred
miles
away
sapphire
obelisk
shimmers
into
solid
reality
for
instant
then
flickers
back
translucence
before
ponderously
beginning
drift
toward
Jekity
Many
more
miles
different
direction
somewhere
deep
within
magmatic
vein
porphyry
shape
that
suggestive
the
human
form
turns
alert
with
new
interest
Another
thing
happens
that
you
may
not
have
guessed
perhaps
you
will
have
because
you
know
Jija
not
But
the
precise
moment
that
his
daughter
rips
boy
protons
loose
Jija
finishes
his
laborious
climb
the
plateau
that
houses
the
Found
Moon
compound
Too
angry
for
courtesy
after
night
seething
shouts
for
his
daughter
Nassun
does
not
hear
him
She
convulsing
the
dormitory
Hearing
the
other
children
screams
Jija
turns
toward
the
building
but
before
can
start
that
direction
two
the
Guardians
emerge
from
their
building
and
move
across
the
compound
Umber
heads
toward
the
dormitory
brisk
pace
Schaffa
veers
off
intercept
Jija
Nassun
will
hear
all
this
later
from
the
children
who
witness
(So
will
cMy
daughter
didn
come
home
last
night
Jija
says
Schaffa
stops
him
his
tracks
Jija
alarmed
the
children
screams
but
not
much
Whatever
madness
happening
within
the
dorm
expects
nothing
better
the
den
iniquity
that
Found
Moon
surely
must
confronts
Schaffa
has
set
his
jaw
that
you
will
recognize
from
other
occasions
which
has
felt
himself
righteous
will
therefore
unwilling
back
down
cShe
will
remaining
here
Schaffa
says
smiling
politely
cWe
found
that
returning
your
home
the
evenings
interfering
with
her
training
Since
your
leg
has
clearly
healed
enough
allow
you
make
the
climb
could
you
kind
bring
her
things
later
today
cShe
The
screams
get
louder
for
moment
Umber
opens
the
door
inside
but
closes
behind
him
and
they
stop
Jija
frowns
this
but
shakes
his
head
order
focus
what
important
cShe
will
not
rusting
staying
here
don
want
her
spending
any
more
time
than
she
has
with
these
stops
short
vulgarity
cShe
isn
one
them
Schaffa
tilts
his
head
for
instant
listening
something
only
can
hear
cIsn
she
His
tone
contemplative
Jija
stares
him
momentarily
confused
into
silence
Then
curses
and
tries
move
past
Schaffa
His
leg
has
indeed
mostly
healed
since
his
arrival
Jekity
but
still
limps
heavily
the
harpoon
having
torn
nerves
and
tendons
that
will
slow
heal
they
ever
fully
Even
had
Jija
been
able
move
easily
however
could
not
have
evaded
the
hand
that
comes
out
nowhere
cover
his
face
Schaffa
big
hand
that
splays
over
his
face
moving
fast
that
blurs
before
seats
itself
Jija
doesn
see
till
over
his
eyes
and
nose
and
mouth
picking
him
bodily
and
slamming
him
the
ground
his
back
Jija
lies
there
blinking
too
dazed
wonder
what
just
happened
too
stunned
for
pain
Then
the
hand
pulls
away
and
from
Jija
perspective
the
Guardian
face
just
there
nose
nearly
touching
Jija
own
cNassun
does
not
have
father
Schaffa
says
softly
(Jija
will
remember
later
that
Schaffa
smiles
the
whole
time
that
says
this
cShe
needs
father
nor
mother
She
does
not
know
this
yet
though
someday
she
will
learn
Shall
teach
her
early
how
without
you
And
positions
two
fingertips
just
under
Jija
jaw
pressing
the
tender
skin
there
with
enough
force
that
Jija
instantly
understands
his
life
depends
his
answer
Jija
goes
still
for
long
pent
breath
There
nothing
his
head
worth
relating
even
speculatively
says
nothing
though
makes
sound
When
the
children
speak
later
this
tableau
they
leave
out
this
detail:
the
small
strangled
whine
uttered
man
who
trying
not
loose
his
bladder
and
bowels
and
who
can
think
nothing
beyond
imminent
death
mostly
nasal
back
the
throat
sound
makes
him
want
cough
Schaffa
seems
take
Jija
whine
for
answer
itself
His
smile
widens
for
moment
real
heartening
smile
the
kind
that
crinkles
the
corners
his
eyes
and
makes
his
gums
show
delighted
that
does
not
have
kill
Nassun
father
with
his
bare
hands
And
then
very
deliberately
lifts
the
hand
that
had
been
positioned
under
Jija
jaw
waggling
the
fingers
before
Jija
eyes
until
Jija
blinks
cThere
Schaffa
says
cNow
may
behave
again
like
civilized
people
straightens
head
turning
toward
the
dormitory
clear
has
forgotten
Jija
already
but
for
afterthought
cDon
forget
bring
her
things
please
Then
rises
steps
over
Jija
and
heads
into
the
dormitory
one
really
cares
what
Jija
does
after
that
boy
has
been
turned
stone
and
girl
has
manifested
power
that
strange
and
horrifying
even
for
rogga
These
are
the
things
everyone
will
remember
about
this
day
Everyone
suspect
except
Jija
who
quietly
limps
home
the
aftermath
the
dormitory
Nassun
has
finally
managed
withdraw
her
awareness
from
the
watery
column
blue
light
that
nearly
consumed
This
amazing
feat
though
she
does
not
realize
All
she
knows
she
finally
comes
out
the
fit
and
finds
Schaffa
leaning
over
her
that
scary
thing
happened
and
Schaffa
there
take
care
her
the
aftermath
(She
your
daughter
her
core
not
for
judge
her
but
she
very
much
yours
cTell
Schaffa
says
has
sat
the
edge
her
cot
very
close
deliberately
blocking
her
view
Eitz
Umber
ushering
the
other
children
out
Peek
weeping
and
hysterical

others

Nassun
does
not
notice

her
own
trauma

with
the
moment
cThere
was

begins
She
hyperventilating
Schaffa
cups
big
hand
over
her
nose
and
mouth
and
after
few
moments
her
breathing
slows
Once
she
closer
normal
removes
his
hand
and
nods
for
her

cThere
was

Light

this
makes
sense
cYou
survived

She
glows
with
this
praise
even
though
she
has
idea
what
means

for
moment
cDid

will
not

much
later
cThere

Lines

All
over
She
means
all
over
the
Stillness
Schaffa
cocks
his
head
with
interest
which
encourages
her
keep
babbling
could
hear
people
talking
Where
they
touched
the
lines
There
were
people
the
knots
Where
the
lines
crossed
couldn
figure
out
what
anybody
was
saying
though
Schaffa
goes
very
still
cPeople

knots
Orogenes
cYes
actually
hard
answer
that
question
The
grip
those
distant
strangers
orogeny
was
strong
some
stronger
than
Nassun
herself
Yet
there
was
strange
almost
uniform
smoothness
each
these
strongest
ones
Like
running
fingers
over
polished
stone:
There

Those
were
also
the
ones
spread
across
the
greatest
distance
some
them
even
farther

north

Tirimo

the
way
near
where
the
world
has
gone
red
and
hot

says
thoughtfully
cHmm

again

back
from

face

you
calm
says
Then
stands
and
moves
aside
that
she
can
see
Eitz
corpse
And
after
she
has
finished
screaming
and
weeping
and
shaking
Schaffa
arms
Nida
and
Umber
come
over
and
lift

carrying
away

much
heavier
than
Eitz
ever
was

doesn

him

beautiful

with
the
sad
smile
and
the
