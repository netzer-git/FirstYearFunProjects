CALLED
HIM
CRAZY
many
times
Told
yourself
that
you
despised
him
even
you
grew
love
him
Why
Perhaps
you
understood
early
that
was
what
you
could
become
More
likely
that
you
suspected
long
before
you
lost
and
found
him
again
that
wasn
crazy
cCrazy
what
everyone
thinks
all
roggas
are
after
all
addled
the
time
they
spend
stone
their
ostensible
alliance
with
the
Evil
Earth
not
being
human
enough
But
cCrazy
also
what
roggas
who
obey
choose
call
roggas
that
don
You
obeyed
once
because
you
thought
would
make
you
safe
showed
you
again
and
again
unrelentingly
would
not
let
you
pretend
otherwise
that
obedience
did
not
make
one
safe
from
the
Guardians
the
nodes
the
lynchings
the
breeding
the
disrespect
then
what
was
the
point
The
game
was
too
rigged
bother
playing
You
pretended
hate
him
because
you
were
coward
But
you
eventually
loved
him
and
part
you
now
because
you
have
since
grown

Antimony
all

down
Alabaster
says
cIt
was
stupid
she
lost
her
grip
her
concentration
had
faltered
for
instant
would
have
become
part
the
stone
Not
even
crushed
just
mixed
lifts
truncated
arm
and
you
know
him
well
enough
realize
would
have
waggled
his
fingers
still
had
fingers
sighs
not
even
noticing
cWe
were
probably
into
the
mantle
the
time
Innon
died
His
voice
soft
gotten
quiet
the
infirmary
You
look
and
around
Lerna
gone
and
one
his
assistants
sleeping
unoccupied
bed
snoring
faintly
You
speak
soft
voice
too
This
conversation
for
only
the
two
you
You
have
ask
though
even
thinking
the
question
makes
you
ache
cDo
you
know
cYes
sessed
how
died
falls
silent
for
moment
You
reverberate
with
his
grief
and
your
own
cCouldn
help
sessing
What
they
those
Guardians
magic
too
just
wrong
Contaminated
like
everything
else
about
their
kind
When
they
shake
person
apart
you
attuned
that
person
feels
like
niner
And
course
you
were
both
attuned
Innon
was
part
you
You
shiver
because
trying
make
you
more
attuned
the
earth
and
orogeny
and
the
obelisks
and
the
unifying
theory
magic
but
you
don
ever
want
experience
that
again
was
bad
enough
seeing
knowing
the
horror
that
resulted
had
once
been
body
you
held
and
loved
had
felt
much
worse
than
niner
couldn
stop
cNo
You
couldn
You
sitting
behind
him
holding
him
upright
with
one
hand
been
gazing
away
from
you
somewhere
into
the
middle
distance
since
began
telling
this
story
does
not
turn
look
you
now
over
his
shoulder
possibly
because
can
without
pain
But
maybe
that
comfort
his
voice
continues:
don
know
how
she
manipulated
the
pressure
the
heat
keep
from
killing
don
know
how
didn
mad
from
knowing
where
was
wanting
get
back
you
realizing
was
helpless
feeling
like
was
suffocating
When
sessed
what
you
did
Coru
shut
down
don
remember
the
rest
the
journey
don
want
must
have
don
know
shudders
tries
You
feel
the
twitch
muscles
his
back
cWhen
came
was
the
surface
again
place
that
hesitates
His
silence
goes
for
long
enough
that
your
skin
prickles
been
there
difficult
describe
That
isn
Alabaster
fault
cOn
the
other
side
the
world
Alabaster
finally
says
cthere
city
The
words
don
make
sense
The
other
side
the
world
great
expanse
trackless
blankness
your
head
map
nothing
but
ocean
cOn

under

ocean
Biggest
one
ever
sessed
you
could
fit
the
Antarctics
into
The
city
sits
directly
above
the
ocean
There
nothing
visible
around
it:
land
for
farming
hills
break
tsunami
harbor
moorings
for
boats
Just
buildings
Trees
and
some
other
plants
varieties
never
seen
elsewhere
gone
wild
but
not
forest
sculpted
into
the
city
sort
don
know
what
call
that
Infrastructures
that
seem
keep
the
whole
thing
stable
and
functioning
but
all
strange
Tubes
and
crystals
and
stuff
that
looks
alive
Couldn
tell
you
how
tenth
worked
And
the
center
the
city
there
hole
hole
You
trying
imagine
cFor
swimming
cNo
There
water
The
hole
goes
into
the
volcano
and
beyond
takes
deep
breath
cThe
city
exists
contain
the
hole
Everything
about
the
city
built
for
that
purpose
Even
its
name
which
the
stone
eaters
told
acknowledges
this:
Corepoint
ruin
Essun
deadciv
ruin
like
any
other
except
that
intact
The
streets
haven
crumbled
The
buildings
are
empty
but
some
the
furniture
even
usable
made
things
not
natural
undecaying
You
could
live
them
you
wanted
paused
did
live
them
when
Antimony
brought
there
There
was
nowhere
else
and
one
else
talk
except
the
stone
eaters
Dozens
them
Essun
maybe
hundreds
They
say
they
didn
build
the
city
but
theirs
now
Has
been
for
tens
thousands
years
You
mindful
how
much
hates
being
interrupted
but
pauses
anyway
Maybe
expecting
commentary
maybe
giving
you
time
absorb
his
words
You
just
staring
the
back
his
head
What
left
his
hair
getting
too
long
you
have
ask
Lerna
for
scissors
and
pick
soon
There
are
absolutely
suitable
thoughts
your
head
besides
this
cIt
something
you
can
help
thinking
about
when
you
confronted
with
sounds
tired
Your
lessons
rarely
last
more
than
hour
and
been
longer
than
that
already
You
would
feel
guilty
you
had
any
emotion
left
you
right
now
other
than
shock
cThe
obelisks
hint
but
they
You
feel
him
try
shrug
You
understand
cNot
something
you
can
touch
walk
through
But
this
city
Recorded
history
goes
back
what
ten
thousand
years
Twenty
five
you
count
all
the
Seasons
the
University
still
arguing
about
But
people
have
been
around
for
much
longer
than
that
Who
knows
when
some
version
our
ancestors
first
crawled
out
the
ash
and
started
jabbering
each
other
Thirty
thousand
years
Forty
long
time
the
pathetic
creatures
are
now
huddling
behind
our
walls
and
putting
all
our
wits
all
our
learning
toward
the
singular
task
staying
alive
That
all
make
now:
Better
ways
field
surgery
with
improvised
equipment
Better
chemicals
can
grow
more
beans
with
little
light
Once
were
much
more
falls
silent
again
for
long
moment
cried
for
you
and
Innon
and
Coru
for
three
days
there
that
city
who
used
You
ache
that
included
you
his
grief
You
don
deserve
cWhen
they
brought
food
Alabaster
skips
past
whatever
would
said
seamlessly
that
first
the
sentence
doesn
make
sense
ate
then
tried
kill
them
His
voice
turns
wry
cTook
while
give
that
actually
but
they
kept
feeding
asked
them
again
and
again
why
they
brought
there
Why
they
were
keeping
alive
Antimony
the
only
one
who
would
speak
first
thought
they
were
deferring
her
but
then
realized
they
just
didn
speak
language
Some
them
weren
used
interacting
with
people
all
They
stared
and
sometimes
had
shoo
them
away
seemed
fascinate
some
disgust
others
The
feeling
was
mutual
learned
some
their
language
eventually
had
Parts
the
city
talked
that
language
you
knew
the
right
words
you
could
open
doors
turn
lights
make
room
warmer
colder
Not
everything
still
worked
The
city
was
breaking
down
Just
slowly
cBut
the
hole
There
were
markers
all
around
lighting
you
got
closer
(You
suddenly
remember
chamber
the
Fulcrum
heart
Long
narrow
panels
igniting
sequence
you
walked
toward
the
socket
glowing
with
discernible
fire

buildings

which
sometimes
glowed

Warnings
that
would
write
themselves

air
before
you

that
would
sound
you
got
too
near
Antimony
took
though
the
first
day
that
was
functional
stood
one
the
barriers
and
looked
down
into
darkness

told
already
that
she
took

couldn

killed
there
Corepoint
heart
she
told
This
why
saved
you
This
the
enemy
you
face
You
are
the
only
one
who
can
What
You
not
confused
You
think
you
understand
You
just
don
want
you
decide
that
you
must
confused
cThat
what
she
said
replies
Now
angry
but
not
you
cWord
for
word
remember
because
was
thinking
that
was
the
reason
Innon
and
Coru
died
and
you
got
thrown
the
rusting
dogs:
because
sometime
the
ass
end
history
some
our
smart
ancestors
decided
dig
hole
the
heart
the
world
for
rusting
reason
for
power
Antimony
said
don
know
how
that
was
supposed
work
but
they
did
and
they
made
the
obelisks
and
other
tools
harness
that
power
cSomething
went
wrong
though
got
the
sense
that
even
Antimony
didn
know
exactly
what
maybe
the
stone
eaters
are
still
arguing
about
and
nobody
come
consensus
Something
just
went
wrong
The
obelisks
misfired
The
Moon
was
flung
away
from
the
planet
Maybe
that
did
maybe
some
other
things
happened
but
whatever
the
cause
the
result
was
the
Shattering
really
happened
Essun
That
what
caused
the
Seasons
The
muscles
his
back
flex
little
against
your
hand
tense
cDo
you
understand

they
just
big
strange

That
city
all
those
wonders
that
deadciv
was
run
orogenes
destroyed

world
just
like
they
always
say
did
Roggas
says
sharply
and
viciously
that
his
whole
body
reverberates
with
the
word
You
feel
how
stiffens
says
Vehemence
hurts
him

would
and
said
anyway
cWhat
they
got
wrong
continues
sounding
weary
now
care
the
loyalties
The
stories
say
agents
Father
Earth
but
the
opposite:
his
enemies
hates
more
than
hates
the
stills
because
what
did
That
why
made
the
Guardians
control
and
You
shaking
your
head
Baster
you
speaking
the
planet
real
Alive
mean
Aware
All
that
stuff
about
Father
Earth
just
stories
explain
what
wrong
with
the
world
Like
those
weird
cults
that
crop
from
time
time
heard
one
that
asks
old
man
the
sky
keep
them
alive
every
time
they
sleep
People
need
believe
there
more
the
world
than
there
And
the
world
just
shit
You
understand
this
now
after
two
dead
children
and
the
repeated
destruction
your
life
There
need
imagine
the
planet
some
malevolent
force
seeking
vengeance
rock
This
just
how
life
supposed
be:
terrible
and
brief
and
ending
you
lucky
oblivion
laughs
This
hurts
him
too
but
laugh
that
makes
your
skin
prickle
because
the
laugh
the
Yumenes
Allia
highroad
The
laugh
dead
node
station
Alabaster
was
never
mad
just
learned
much
that
would
have
driven
lesser
soul
gibbering
that
sometimes
shows
Letting
out
some
that
accumulated
horror
occasionally
sounding
like
frothing
maniac
how
copes
also
how
warns
you
you
know
now
that
about
destroy
some
additional
measure
your
naivete
Nothing
ever
simple
you
want
cThat
probably
how
they
thought
Alabaster
says
when
his
laugh
goes
quiet
cThe
ones
who
decided
dig
hole
the
world
core
But
just
because
you
can
see
understand
thing
doesn
mean
can
hurt
you
You
know
that
true
But
more
importantly
you
hear
the
knowledge
Alabaster
voice
makes
you
tense
cWhat
have
you
seen
cEverything
Your
skin
prickles
takes
deep
breath
When
speaks
again
monotone
cThis
three
sided
war
More
sides
than
that
but
only
three
that
you
need
concern
yourself
with
All
three
sides
want
the
war
end
just
question
how
the
problem
you
see
people
Two
the
sides
are
trying
decide
what
should
done
with
That
phrasing
explains
lot
cThe
Earth
and
the
stone
eaters
Always
lurking
planning
wanting
something
unknown
cNo
They
people
too
Essun
Haven
you
figured
that
out
They
need
things
want
things
feel
things
same
way
And
they
been
fighting
this
war
much
much
longer
than
you
Some
them
from
the
very
beginning
cThe
beginning
What
the
Shattering
cYes
some
them
are
that
old
Antimony
one
That
little
one
who
follows
you
too
think
There
are
others
They
can
die
yeah
Some
them
saw
all
happen
You
too
floored
really

old

thousand

cOne
side
wants
people
dead
Alabaster
says
cThat
one
way
end
things
suppose
One
side
wants
people
neutralized
Alive
but
rendered
harmless
Like
the
stone
eaters
themselves:
Earth
tried
make
them
more
like
itself
dependent
itself
thinking
that
would
make
them
harmless
sighs
guess
reassuring
know
the
planet
can
cock
too
Your
flinch
delayed
reaction
because
you
still
got
Hoa
mind
cHe
used

you
murmur
Yes
just

now
long
discarded
set

again
for
old
times
sake

once
upon
time

boy
who
looked
like

There
nothing
Sanzed
him
because
the
Sanzed
did
not
exist
people
his
day
cThey
all
did
what
wrong
with
them
very
tired
now
which
may
why
speaks
more
softly
can
barely
remember
things
that
happened
fifty
years
ago
imagine
trying
remember
five
thousand
years
ago
Ten
thousand
Twenty
Imagine
forgetting
your
own
name
That
why
they
never
answer
when
ask
them
who
they
are
You
inhale
realization
don
think
what
they
made
that
makes
stone
eaters
different
think
that
one
can
live
that
long
and
not
become
something
entirely
alien
keeps
saying

and
you
can
course
you
can
But
you
can
think
Hoa

moment

fascinated

Curling
against

sorrow

you

best
Failing
the
end

three
sides

Focusing
what
you
can

what
you
can
Alabaster
beginning
slouch
leaning
harder
against
your
hand
needs
rest
Alabaster
silent
for
long
that
you
think
might
have
fallen
asleep
Then
says
slipped
out
one
night
when
Antimony
wasn
there
been
there
years
Time
got
loose
after
while
one
but
them
talk
and
sometimes
they
forget
that
people
need
talk
Nothing
the
earth
listen
except
the
grumbling
the
volcano
The
stars
are
all
wrong
that
side
the
world
trails
off
for
moment
Loose
time
catching
with

looking

the
obelisks
trying
understand
what
their
builders
intended

hurt

you
were
alive
and
missed
you
much
was
sick
with
had
this
sudden
wild
half
rusted
thought:
Maybe
through
the
hole
could
get
back
you
only
had
hand
left
that
you
could
take
Your
fingers
twitch
against
his
back
instead
not
the
same
cSo
ran
the
hole
and
jumped
not
suicide
you
don
mean

that
what
told
myself
Another
felt
smile
cBut
wasn
The
things
around
the
hole
are
mechanisms
but
not
just
for
warning
must
have
triggered
something
maybe
that
was
how
they
were
meant
work
went
down
but
wasn
like
falling
was
controlled
somehow
Fast
but
steady
should
have
died
Air
pressure
heat
the
same
things
Antimony
took
through
without
the
rock
involved
but
Antimony
wasn
there
and
should
have
died
There
are
lights
along
the
shaft
intervals
Windows
think
People
actually
used
live
down
there
But
mostly
just
the
dark
cEventually
hours
days
later
slowed
down
had
reached
stops
You
feel
the
prickle
goose
bumps
rise
his
skin
cThe
Earth
alive
His
voice
grows
harsh
hoarse
faintly
hysterical
cSome
the
old
stories
are
just
stories
you
right
but
not
that
one
understood
then
what
the
stone

had
been
trying
tell

Alabaster
pauses
suddenly
for
long
and
pent
moment
You
want
ask
what
will
happen
war
ancient
doesn
end
soon
You
want
ask
what
happened
him
down
there
the
core
the
Earth
what
saw
experienced
that
has
plainly
shaken
him
You
don
ask
You
brave
woman
but

you
can
take
and
what
you
can
whispers:
cWhen

cGive
Antimony
she
has
heard
her
name
suddenly
Antimony
reappears
standing
before
you
both
You
glare
her
realizing
that
this
means
Alabaster
has
reached
the
end
his
strength
and
that
the
conversation
must
end
makes
you
resent
his
weakness
and
hate
that
dying
makes
you
seek
scapegoat
for
that
hatred
cNo

Antimony
blurs
that
stone
eaterish
way
slow
except
when
they
aren
and
then
she
crouched
beside
him
using
both
hands
now
hold
and
support
him
slips
into
sleep
You
gaze
Antimony
You
thought
her
enemy
all
this
time
but
what
Alabaster
says
true
cNo
you
snap
You
not
really
saying
her
but
works
either
way
not
ready
think
you
ally
yet
Maybe
not
ever
cEven
you
were
says
the
voice
from
within
the
stone
eater
chest
his
ally
Not
yours
People

with
wants
and
needs
You
want
reject
this
too
but
oddly
comforts
you
know
that
she
doesn
like

cAlabaster
said
understood

you
did
what
you
did
But
don
understand
why
did
what
did

said
this
was
three
sided
war
what
the
third
side
Which
side
How
does
the
Rift
help
matter
how
you
try
you
cannot
imagine
Antimony
having
once
been
human
Too
many
things
work
against
it:
the
stillness
her
face
the
dislocation
her
voice
The
fact
that
you
hate
her
cThe
Obelisk
Gate
amplifies
energies
both
physical
and
arcane
single
point
surface
venting
produces
these
energies
sufficient
quantity
The
Rift
reliable
high

source
Meaning
You
tense
cYou
saying
that
use

ambient
source
channel
through
torus
cNo
That
would
simply
kill
you
cWell
thanks
for
the
warn
off
You
beginning
understand
though
the
same
problem
you
keep
having
with
Alabaster
lessons
heat
and
pressure
and
motion
are
not
the
only
forces
play
here
cYou
saying
the
earth
churns
out
magic
too
And
push
that
magic
into
obelisk
You
blink
recalling
her
words
cObelisk
Gate
Antimony
gaze
has
been
focused
Alabaster
Now
her
flat
black
eyes
slide
finally
meet
yours
cThe
two
hundred
and
sixteen
individual
obelisks
networked
together
via
the
control
cabochon
While
you
stand
there
wondering
what
the
rust
control
cabochon
and
marveling
that
there
are
more
than
two
hundred
the
damned
things
she
adds
cUsing
that
channel
the
power
the
Rift
should
enough
cTo
what
For
the
first
time
you
hear
note
emotion
her
voice:
annoyance
cTo
impose
equilibrium
the
Earth
Moon
system
What
cAlabaster
said
the
Moon
was
flung
away
cInto
degrading
long
ellipsis
orbit
When
you
stare
blankly
she
speaks
your
language
again
cIt
coming
back
Earth
rust
You
want
catch
the
fucking
Moon
She
just
stares
you
and
belatedly
you
realize
you
practically
shouting
You
throw
guilty
look
Alabaster
but
hasn
woken
Neither
has
the
nurse
the
far
cot
When
she
sees
that
you
quiet
Antimony
says
cThat
option
Almost
afterthought
she
adds
cAlabaster
made
the
first
two
necessary
course
corrections
the
Moon
slowing
and
altering
the
trajectory
that
would
have
taken
past
the
planet
again
Someone
else
must
make
the
second
correction
bringing
back
into
stable
orbit
and
magical
alignment
Should
equilibrium
reestablished
likely
the
Seasons
will
end
diminish
such
infrequency
mean
the
same
thing
your
kind
You
inhale
but
you
get
now
Give
Father
Earth
back
his
lost
child
and
perhaps
his
wrath
will
appeased
That
the
third
faction
then:
those
who
want
truce
people
and
Father
Earth
agreeing
tolerate
one
another
even
means
creating
the
Rift
and
killing
millions
the
process
Peaceful
coexistence
any
means
necessary
The
end
the
Seasons
sounds
unimaginable
There
have
always
been
Seasons
Except
now
you
know
that
isn
true
cThen
isn
option
you
say
finally
cEnd
the
Seasons
watch
everything
die
this
Season
burns
forever
Catch
the
Moon
sounds
ridiculous
what
you
stone
eaters
want
then
cThere
are
always
options
Her
gaze
alien
abruptly
shifts
subtle
way
maybe
you
just
reading
her
better
Suddenly
she
looks
human
and
very
very
bitter
cAnd
not
all
kind
want
the
same
thing
You
frown
her
but
she
says
nothing
more
You
want
ask
more
questions
try
harder
understand
but
she
was
right:
You
weren
ready
for
this
Your
head
spinning
and
the
words
stuffed
into
are
starting
blur
and
jumble
together
too
much
deal
with
Wants
and
needs
You
swallow
cCan
stay
here
She
does
not
respond
You
suppose
wasn
really
necessary
ask
You
get
and
move
the
nearest
cot
Its
head
against
the
wall
which
would
put
your
head
behind
Alabaster
and
Antimony
and
you
don
feel
like
staring
the
back
the
stone
eater
head
You
grab
the
pillow
and
curl
with
your
head
the
foot
the
bed
instead
you
can
see
Alabaster
face
Once
you
slept
better
when
you
could
see
him
across
the
expanse
Innon
shoulders
This
not
the
same
reassurance
but
something
After
while
Antimony
begins
sing
again
strangely
relaxing
You
sleep
better
than
you
have
months
