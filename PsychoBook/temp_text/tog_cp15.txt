PASS
THE
undifferentiated
white
light
ancient
magic
fueled
survival
shelter
After
the
first
few
days
you
start
wrapping
cloth
around
your
eyes
when
you
tired
create
your
own
day
and
night
works
passably
Tonkee
arm
survives
the
reattachment
though
she
gets
bad
infection
one
point
which
Lerna
basic
antibiotics
seem
powerless
stop
She
lives
though
the
time
the
fever
and
livid
infection
lines
have
faded
her
fingers
have
lost
some
their
fine
movement
and
she
gets
phantom
tinglings
and
numbness
throughout
the
limb
Lerna
thinks
this
will
permanent
Tonkee
mutters
imprecations
about
sometimes
whenever
you
track
her
down
the
middle
core
sampling
whatever
she
doing
and
force
her
meet
with
the
Innovator
caste
head
Whenever
she
gets
too
free
with
the
carm
chopper
insults
you
remind
her
first
that
unleashing
piece
the
Evil
Earth
crawl
through
her
flesh
was
her
own
damned
fault
and
second
that
you
the
only
reason
Ykka
hasn
had
her
killed
yet
maybe
she
should
consider
shutting
She
does
but
she
still
ass
about
Nothing
ever
really
changes
the
Stillness
And
yet
sometimes
things
Lerna
forgives
you
for
being
monster
That
not
exactly
You
and
still
can
talk
about
Tirimo
easily
Still
heard
your
raging
fight
with
Ykka
all
through
the
surgery
that
performed
Tonkee
arm
and
that
means
something
him
Ykka
wanted
Tonkee
left
die
the
table
You
argued
for
her
life
and
won
Lerna
knows
now
that
there
more
you
than
death
You
not
sure
you
agree
with
that
assessment
but
relief
have
something
your
old
friendship
back
Hjarka
starts
courting
Tonkee
Tonkee
doesn
react
well
first
She
mostly
just
confused
when
gifts
dead
animals
and
books
start
appearing
the
apartment
brought
with
too
casual
cIn
case
that
big
brain
hers
needs
something
chew
and
wink
You
the
one
who
has
explain
Tonkee
that
Hjarka
decided
through
whatever
convoluted
set
values
the
big
woman
holds
dear
that
commless
geomest
with
the
social
skills
rock
represents
the
pinnacle
desirability
Then
Tonkee
mostly
annoyed
complaining
about
cdistractions
and
cthe
vagaries
the
ephemeral
and
the
need
cdecenter
the
flesh
You
mostly
ignore
all
the
books
that
settle
the
issue
Hjarka
seems
pick
them
the
number
many
syllabled
words
their
spines
but
you
come
home
few
times
find
Tonkee
engrossed
them
Eventually
you
come
home
find
Tonkee

drawn
and
Tonkee
engrossed
Hjarka
the
sounds
from
beyond
would
suggest
You
didn
think
they
could

Huh
Perhaps
this

causes
Tonkee

trying
prove
her
worth
Ykka
(Or
maybe
just

bristles
when
Ykka
once
says
that
Tonkee

Strongback
Whatever
the
reason
Tonkee
brings
the
council
new
predictive
model
that
she
worked
out:
Unless
Castrima
finds
stable
source

protein
some
comm
members
will
start
showing
deprivation
symptoms
within

cIt
start
with

she
tells
all
you

things

that
But
kind
anemia
goes
the
result

and
nerve
damage
You
can
figure
out
the
rest
There
are
too
many
lorist
tales
what
can
happen
comm
without

make
people

The

will
prevent

outcome
Tonkee
explains

Planting
more

just
isn
enough
The
report
useful
information
but
nobody
really
wanted
hear
and
Ykka
doesn
like
Tonkee
any
better

One

gets

without

someone

the
way
for
the
unauthorized

You
get
into
another
fight
with
Ykka
about
that
because
you
know
full
well
she
meant
Alabaster
when
she
offhandedly
added
cShouldn
long
the
woman
Ykka
unapologetic:
She
did
mean
Alabaster
and
she
hopes
dies
soon
because
least
baby
has
future
value
Two
good
outcomes
result
from
that
fracas:
Everyone
trusts
you
more
after
seeing
you
shout

Flat

without
causing
much
tremor
and
the
Breeders
decide
speak
for
the
new
baby

settle
the
dispute
Based
the
favorable
recent
genealogy
they
contribute
one

child
allocations

family
though
with
the
stipulation
that

That
not
terrible
price

the
road
with
only

during
these

The

You
just
react
like

the

like
Syenite
the

Everything
you
crystallizes
and
sharpens

your

down
razor
point
and
you
weave
the

that
you
barely
noticed

there
and
happens
just
like
with
Tonkee

shiiiiing
You
slice
the

off
and

drop
the

People
gasp
There
blood
Hoa

hits
the

with
loud
meaty

heavier
than

the

makes
second
even
more
solid
clack
separating
from

The
cross
section
its

undifferentiated
gray
The
stone

does
not
seem
react
first
Then
you
sess
the
coalescence
something
like
the
silver
threads
magic
but
many
The
hand
twitches
then
leaps
into
the

returning
the
wrist
stump
pulled
strings
leaves
Hoa

behind
Then
the
stone

turns
fully

you
last
cGet
out
before
chop
you
into
more
pieces
than
you
can

you

that
shakes

The
gray

smiles
full

crinkling
with

Then
vanishes
falling
through
the

the

For
instant
you
see
gray
shadow
within
the
crystal
translucence
his

blurred

not

There
are

Silver
lines
that
only
you
can
see

and
curling

from

Not

The

You
step

Hjarka
the

There
are
two
more

the

front
you
bloody
stumps
with
diamond
bones
poking
forth
they
are

they
are
the
floor
partially
submerged
one
down
the
thigh
the
other
just
calf
and
foot
Caught
climbing
out
There
are
twin
trails
blood
thick
enough
worrisome
over
the
homey
rug
that
you
bartered
one
Jija
old
flintknives
for
They
toward
your
room
you
follow
them
And
then
you
drop
the
arm
Fortunately
does
not
land
your
foot
What
left
Hoa
crawls
toward
the
floor
mattress
that
passes
for
your

His
other

also
gone
you
don
know
where
Hanks
his
hair
are
missing
pauses
when
you
come
hearing
sessing
you
and
lies
still
you
circle
him
and
see
that
his
lower
jaw
has
been
ripped
away
has
eyes
and
there
bite
just
above
his
temple
That
why
his
hair
missing
Something
has
bitten
into
his
skull
like
apple
incising
chunk
flesh
and
the
diamond
bone
underneath
You
can
see
what
inside
his
head
for
the
blood
That
good
would
frighten
you
you
did
not
immediately
understand
Beside
your
bed
the
little
cloth
wrapped
bundle
that
has
carried
since

the

from

directly
into
the
ragged
hole
Hoa
throat
The
feel
his

warm

push
down
with
your
finger
until
the

his
swallowing
reflex
catch

You
start

him

but
after
few
breaths
begins
shiver
all
over
violently
You
don
realize
you
still
sessing
magic
until
suddenly
Hoa
body
becomes
alive
with
glimmering
silver
threads
all
them
whipping
about
and
curling
like
the
stinging
tentacles
ocean
creatures
from
lorists
tales
Hundreds
them
You
draw
back
alarm
but
Hoa
makes
raw
breathy
sound
and
you
think
maybe
means
more
You
push
another
stone
into
his
throat
and
then
another
There
weren
many

with

down

You
don
understand

from

lashing
magic

him
alive
with
you
never

anything

this
nothing
about
his
damaged
body
improving
Can
anyone
survive
recover
from
this
degree
damage
not
human
enough
for
you
even
guess
But
finally
croaks
again
deeper
sound
than
the
first
Resigned
maybe
maybe
that
your
imagination
patterning
humanity
over
the
animal
sounds
his
animal
flesh
you
push
the
last
three
stones
into
him
Nothing
happens
for
moment
Then
Silver
tendrils
billow
and
swell
around
him
rapidly
with
such
frenzy
that
you
scramble
back
You
know
some
the
things
that
magic
can
and
something
about
this
seems
altogether
wild
and
uncontrolled
fills
the
room
though
and
and
you
blink
You
can
see
not
just
sess
All
Hoa
glimmers
now
with
silver
white
light
growing
rapidly
too
bright
look
directly
even
still
would
able
see
this
You
move
into
the
living
room
peering
through
the
bedroom
door
because
that
seems
safer
The
instant
you
cross
the
room
threshold
the
substance
the
whole
apartment
walls
floor
everywhere
there
crystal
shivers
for
instant
becoming
translucent
and
obelisk
unreal
Your
bedroom
furniture
and
belongings
float
amid
the
flickering
white
There
soft
thump
from
behind
you
that
makes
you
jump
and
whirl
but
Hoa
legs
which
are
out
the
living
room
floor
and
sliding
along
the
trails
blood
into
your
room
The
arm
you
dropped
moving
too
already
nudging
against
the
bright
morass
him
becoming
bright
too
Leaping
rejoin
his
body
the
gray
stone
eater
hand
rejoined
his
wrist
Something
slides
from
the
floor
You
see
the
floor
slide
were
putty
and
not
crystal
and
wrap
itself
around
his
body
The
light
dies
when
does
the
material
immediately
begins
change
into
something
darker
When
you
blink
away
the
afterimages
enough
see
there
something
huge
and
strange
and
impossible
where
Hoa
once
was
You
step
back
into
the
bedroom
carefully
because
the
floor
and
walls
might
solid
again
but
you
know
that
possibly
temporary
state
The
once
smooth
crystal
rough
beneath
your
feet
The
thing
takes
most
the
room
now
lying
next
your
disordered
bed
that
now
half
submerged
the
resolidified
floor
hot
Your
foot
tangles
briefly
the
strap
your
half
empty
runny
sack
which
fortunately
still
intact
and
unmerged
with
the
room
You
stoop
quickly
and
grab
the
habits
survival
Earthfires
hot
here
The
bed
does
not
catch
fire
but
you
think
that
only
because
not
directly
touching
the
big
thing
You
can
sess
whatever
you
know
what
is:
chalcedony
huge
oblong
lump
gray
green
chalcedony
like
the
outer
shell
geode
You
already
know
what
happening
don
you
told
you
Tirimo
after
the
Rifting
The
far
end
the
valley
where
the
shockwave
the
shake
loosed
geode
that
then
split
open
like
egg
The
geode
hadn
been
there
all
along
you
realize
this
magic
not
nature
Well
perhaps
bit
both
For
stone
eaters
there
little
difference
between
the
two
And
the
morning
after
you
spend
the
night
the
living
room
table
where
you
meant
stay
awake
and
watch
the
steaming
lump
rock
but
instead
fell
asleep
happens
again
The
cracking
open
the
geode
loud
explosively
violent
flicker
pressure
driven
plasma
curls
forth
and
scorches
melts
all
the
belongings
you
left
the
room
Except
the
runny
sack
since
you
took
Good
instincts
You
shaking
from
being
startled
awake
Slowly
you
stand
and
edge
into
the
room
hot
that
hard
breathe
Like
oven
though
the
waft
warmth
causes
the
apartment
entry
curtain
billow
open
Quickly
the
heat
diminishes
only
uncomfortable
and
not
dangerous
You
barely
notice
Because
what
rises
from
the
split
the
geode
moving
too
human
smoothly
