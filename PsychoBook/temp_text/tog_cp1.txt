Damaya
was
herself

the

that
rejected

Now
you

and
also
the

Whom

That
not

You
are
Essun

You

already
Don
you
Nassun
next
then
Nassun
who
just
eight
years
old
when
the
world
ends
There
knowing
what
went
through
little
Nassun
mind
when
she
came
home
from
her
apprenticeship
one
afternoon
find
her
younger
brother
dead
the
den
floor
and
her
father
standing
over
the
corpse
can
imagine
what
she
thought
felt
did
can
speculate
But
will
not
know
Perhaps
that
for
the
best
Here
what
know
for
certain:
that
apprenticeship
mentioned
Nassun
was
training
become
lorist
The
Stillness
has
odd
relationship
with
its
self
appointed
keepers
stonelore
There
are
records
lorists
existing
far
back
the
long
rumored
Eggshell
Season
That
the
one
which
some
sort
gaseous
emission
caused
all
children
born
the
Arctics
for
several
years
have
delicate
bones
that
broke
with
touch
and
bent
they
grew
they
grew
(Yumenescene
archeomests
have
argued
for
centuries
over
whether
this
could
have
been
caused
strontium
arsenic
and
whether
should
counted
Season
all
given
that
only
affected
few
hundred
thousand
weak
pallid
little
barbarians
the
northern
tundra
But
that
when
the
peoples
the
Arctics
gained
reputation
for
weakness
About
twenty
five
thousand
years
ago
according
the
lorists
themselves
which
most
people
think
blatant
lie
truth
lorists
are
even
older
part
life
the
Stillness
Twenty
five
thousand
years
ago
simply
when
their
role
became
distorted
into
near
uselessness
They
still
around
though
they
forgotten
how
much
they
forgotten
Somehow
their
order
can
called
order
survives
despite
the
First
through
Seventh
Universities
disavowing
their
work
apocryphal
and
probably
inaccurate
and
despite
governments
down
all
the
ages
undermining
their
knowledge
with
propaganda
And
despite
the
Seasons
course
Once
lorists
came
only
from
race
called
Regwo
Westcoasters
who
had
sallow
reddish
skin
and
naturally
black
lips
and
who
worshipped
the
preservation
history
the
way
people
less
bitter
times
worshipped
gods
They
used
chisel
stonelore
into
mountainsides
tablets
high
the
sky
that
all
would
see
and
know
the
wisdom
needed
survive
Alas:
the
Stillness
destroying
mountains
easy
orogene
toddler
temper
tantrum
Destroying
people
takes
only
bit
more
effort
lorists
are
longer
Regwo
but
most
them
tint
their
lips
black
the
Regwo
memory
Not
that
they
remember
why
anymore
Now
just
how
one
knows
lorist:
the
lips
and
the
stack
polymer
tablets
they
carry
and
the
shabby
clothes
they
tend
wear
and
the
fact
that
they
usually
not
have
real
comm
names
They
aren
commless
mind
theory
they
could
return
their
home
comms
the
event
Season
although
profession
they
tend
wander
far
enough
make
returning
impractical
practice
many
communities
will
take
them
even
during
Season
because
even
the
most
stoic
community
wants
entertainment
during
the
long
cold
nights
For
this
reason
most
lorists
train
the
arts
music
and
comedy
and
such
They
also
act
teachers
and
caretakers
the
young
times
when
one
else
can
spared
for
such
duty
and
most
importantly
they
serve
living
reminder
that
others
have
survived
worse
through
the
ages
Every
comm
needs
that
The
lorist
who
has
come
Tirimo
named
Renthree
Lorist
Stone
(All
lorists
take
the
comm
name
Stone
and
the
use
name
Lorist
being
one
the
rarer
use
castes
She
mostly
unimportant
but
there
reason
you
must
know
her
She
was
once
Renthree
Breeder
Tenteek
but
that
was
before
she
fell
love
with
lorist
who
visited
Tenteek
and
seduced
the
then
young
woman
away
from
boring
life
glass
smith
Her
life
would
have
become
slightly
more
interesting
Season
had
occurred
before
she
left
for
Breeder
responsibility
those
times
clear
and
perhaps
that
too
what
spurred
her
away
maybe
was
just
the
usual
folly
young
love
Hard
say
Renthree
lorist
lover
eventually
left
her
the
outskirts
the
Equatorial
city
Penphen
with
broken
heart
and
head
full
lore
and
wallet
full
chipped
jades
and
cabochons
and
one
shoeprint
stained
lozenge
mother
pearl
Renthree
spent
the
mother
pearl
commission
her
own
set
tablets
from
knapper
used
the
jade
chips
buy
traveling
supplies
and
stay
inn
for
the
days
took
the
knapper
finish
and
bought
many
strong
drinks
tavern
with
the
cabochons
Then
newly
outfitted
and
with
wounds
patched
she
set
out
her
own
Thus
does
the
profession
perpetuate
itself
When
Nassun
appears
the
way
station
where
she
has
set
shop
possible
that
Renthree
thinks
about
her
own
apprenticeship
(Not
the
seduction
part
obviously
Renthree
likes
older
women
emphasis
women
The
foolish
dreamer
part
The
day
previous
Renthree
passed
through
Tirimo
shopping
market
stalls
and
smiling
cheerfully
through
her
black
daubed
lips
advertise
her
presence
the
area
She
did
not
see
Nassun
her
way
home
from
creche
stop
and
stare
awe
and
sudden
irrational
hope
Nassun
has
skipped
creche
today
come
and
find
her
and
bring
offering
This
traditional
the
offering
that
and
not
teachers
daughters
skipping
creche
Two
adults
from
town
are
already
the
way
station
sitting
bench
listen
while
Renthree
talks
and
Renthree
offering
cup
has
already
been
filled
with
brightly
colored
shards
faceted
with
the
quartent
mark
Renthree
blinks
surprise
the
sight
Nassun:
gangly
girl
who
more
leg
than
torso
more
eyes
than
face
and
very
obviously
too
young
out
creche
early
when
isn
harvest
season
Nassun
stops
the
threshold
the
way
station
panting
catch
her
breath
which
makes
for
very
dramatic
entrance
The
other
two
visitors
turn
stare
her
Jija
normally
quiet
firstborn
and
only
their
presence
stops
Nassun
from
blurting
her
intentions
right
then
and
there
Her
mother
has
taught
her
very
circumspect
(Her
mother
will
hear
about
her
skipping
creche
Nassun
doesn
care
She
swallows
however
and
goes
Renthree
immediately
hold
out
something:
dark
chunk
rock
embedded
which
can
seen
small
almost
cubical
diamond
Nassun
doesn
have
any
money
beyond
her
allowance
you
see
and
she
already
spent
that
books
and
sweets
when
word
came
that
lorist
was
town
But
one
Tirimo
knows
that
there
potentially
excellent
diamond
mine
the
region
one
that
except
orogenes
And
then
only
they
looking
Nassun
the
only
one
who
bothered
several
thousand
years
She
knows
she
should
not
have
found
this
diamond
Her
mother
has
taught
her
not
display
her
orogeny
and
not
use
outside
carefully
proscribed
practice
sessions
that
they
undertake
nearby
valley
every
few
weeks
one
carries
diamonds
for
currency
because
they
can
sharded
for
change
easily
but
they
still
useful
industry
mining
and
the
like
Nassun
knows
has
some
value
but
she
has
inkling
that
the
pretty
rock
she
just
given
Renthree
worth
house
two
She
only
eight
And
Nassun
excited
when
she
sees
Renthree
eyes
widen
the
sight
the
glittering
lump
poking
out
the
black
hunk
rock
that
she
stops
caring
that
there
are
others
present
and
blurts
want
lorist
too
Nassun
has
idea
what
lorist
really
does
course
She
just
knows
that
she
wants
very
very
much
leave
Tirimo
More
this
later
Renthree
would
fool
refuse
the
offering
and
she
doesn
But
she
doesn
give
Nassun
answer
right
away
partly
because
she
thinks
Nassun
cute
and
that
her
declaration
different
from
any
other
child
momentary
passion
(She
right
degree
last
month
Nassun
wanted
geneer
Instead
she
asks
Nassun
sit
and
then
she
tells
stories
her
small
audience
for
the
rest
the
afternoon
until
the
sun
makes
long
shadows
down
the
valley
slope
and
through
the
trees
When
the
other
two
visitors
get
head
home
they
eye
Nassun
and
drop
hints
until
she
reluctantly
comes
with
them
because
the
people
Tirimo
will
not
have
said
that
they
disrespected
lorist
letting
some
child
talk
her
death
all
night
the
wake
her
visitors
Renthree
stokes
the
fire
and
starts
making
dinner
from
bit
pork
belly
and
greens
and
cornmeal
that
she
bought
Tirimo
the
day
before
While
she
waits
for
dinner
cook
and
eats
apple
she
turns
Nassun
rock
her
fingers
fascinated
And
troubled
the
morning
she
heads
into
Tirimo
few
discreet
inquiries
lead
her
Nassun
home
Essun
gone
this
point
off
teach
the
last
her
career
creche
teacher
Nassun
gone
off
creche
too
though
she
biding
her
time
till
she
can
escape
lunchtime
find
the
lorist
again
Jija
his
cworkshop
calls
the
offset
room
that
passes
for
the
house
basement
where
works
commissions
with
his
noisy
tools
during
the
day
Uche
asleep
pallet
the
same
room
can
sleep
through
anything
The
songs
the
earth
have
always
been
his
lullaby
Jija
comes
the
door
when
Renthree
knocks
and
for
instant
she
little
taken
aback
Jija
Midlatter
mongrel
same
Essun
though
his
heritage
leans
more
toward
the
Sanzed
big
and
brown
and
muscular
and
bald
shaven
Intimidating
Yet
the
welcoming
smile
his
face
wholly
genuine
which
makes
Renthree
feel
better
about
what
she
decided
This
good
man
She
cannot
cheat
him
cHere
she
says
giving
him
the
diamond
rock
She
can
possibly
take
such
valuable
gift
from
child
not
exchange
for
few
stories
and
apprenticeship
that
Nassun
will
probably
change
her
mind
about
few
months
Jija
frowns
confusion
and
takes
the
rock
thanking
her
profusely
after
hears
her
explanation
promises
spread
the
tale
Renthree
generosity
and
integrity
everyone
can
which
will
hopefully
give
her
more
opportunities
practice
her
art
before
she
leaves
town
Renthree
leaves
and
that
the
end
her
part
this
tale
significant
part
however
which
why
told
you
her
There
was
not
any
one
thing
that
turned
Jija
against
his
son
understand
Over
the
years
simply
had
noticed
things
about
his
wife
and
his
children
that
stirred
suspicion
the
depths
his
mind
That
stirring
had
grown
tickle
then
outright
irritant
the
point
which
this
tale
begins
but
denial
kept
him
from
worrying
the
thought
any
further
loved
his
family
after
all
and
the
truth
was
simply
unthinkable
Literally
would
have
figured
out
eventually
one
way
another
repeat:
would
have
figured
out
eventually
one
blame
but
him
But
you
want
simple
explanation
and
there
can
any
one
event
that
became
the
tipping
point
the
camel
straw
the
broken
plug
the
lava
tube
was
this
rock
Because
Jija
knew
stone
you
see
was
excellent
knapper
knew
stone
and
knew
Tirimo
and
knew
that
veins
igneous
rock
from
ancient
volcano
ran
all
through
the
surrounding
land
Most
did
not
breach
the
surface
but
was
entirely
possible
that
Nassun
could
chance
find
diamond
sitting
out
where
anyone
could
pick
Unlikely
But
possible
This
understanding
floats
the
surface
Jija
mind
for
the
rest
the
day
after
Renthree
leaves
The
truth
beneath
the
surface
leviathan
waiting
uncurl
but
the
waters
his
thoughts
are
placid
for
now
Denial
powerful
But
then
Uche

Jija

him
into
the

When

life
The

color

but
the
shape
her
face
Jija
Just
the
sight
her
pulls
him
step
away
from
the
primal
panic
into
which
has
descended
She
tells
the
truth
too
That
helps
because
wouldn
have
believed
anything
else
cYes
she
says
She
not
really
afraid
this
moment
The
sight
her
brother
body
and
her
mind
refusal
interpret
what
she
seeing
have
frozen
all
cognition
within
her
She
not
even
sure
what
Jija
asking
since
understanding
the
context
his
words
would
require
her
acknowledge
that
what
stains
her
father
fists
blood
and
that
her
brother
not
merely
sleeping
the
floor
She
can
Not
right
then
But
absent
any
more
coherent
thought
and
children
sometimes
extreme
situations
Nassun
regresses
What
she
sees
frightens
her
even
she
does
not
understand
why
And
the
two
her
parents
Jija
whom
Nassun
has
always
been
closer
She
his
favorite
too:
the
firstborn
the
one
never
expected
have
the
one
with
his
face
and
his
sense
humor
She
likes
his
favorite
foods
had
vague
hopes
her
following
his
footsteps
knapper
when
she
starts
crying
she
does
not
quite
know
why
And
her
thoughts
skirl
about
and
her
heart
screams
she
takes
step
toward
him
His
fists
tighten
but
she
cannot
see
him
threat
her
father
She
wants
comfort

says
Jija

Blinks
Stares

never
seen
her
before
Realizes
cannot
kill
her
Not
even
she
She
his
little
girl
She
steps
forward
again
reaching
out
cannot
make
himself
reach
back
but
does
hold
still
She
grabs
his
nearer
wrist
stands
straddling
Uche
body
she
can
grab
him
around
the
waist
the
way
she
wants
She
does
however
press
her
face
against
his
bicep
comfortingly
strong
She
does
tremble
and
does
feel
her
tears
sliding
down
his
skin
stands
there
breath
gradually
slowing
fists
gradually
uncurling
while
she
weeps
After
time
turns
face
her
fully
and
she
wraps
arms
around
his
waist
Turning
face
her
requires
turning
away
from
what
done
Uche
easy
movement
murmurs
her
cGet
your
things
you
were
going
spend
few
nights

Nassun
asks
against
his
belly
touches
the
back
her
head
always
done
this
because
she
always
liked
the
gesture
When
she
was
baby
she
cooed
louder
when
cupped
her
there
This
because
the
sessapinae
are
located
that
region
the
brain
and
when
touches
her
there
she
can
perceive
him
more
completely
orogenes
Neither
them
has
ever
known
why
she
likes
much
cWe

can
better
says
gently
cSomewhere

Make

little

not
turns
away
from
this
thought
too
She
swallows
then
nods
and
steps
back
looking
him
cIs

Something

cNo
And
Nassun
who
was
fully
prepared
off
into
the
sunset

some
lorist
