body
Yes
that
was
one
the
problems
said
the
former
king
studied
did
quite
well
the
examinations
small
string
the
upper
end
the
harp
broke
with
high
pitched
tinkle
and
curled
like
ivy
tendril
did
quite
poorly
went
and
the
Council
Bards
wouldn
admit
Really
they
want
you
know
much
these
days
Volumes
and
volumes
poetry
and
chants
and
music
and
calculating
the
seasons
and
history
and
all
kinds
alphabets
you
spell
out
your
fingers
and
secret
signs
man
couldn
hope
cram
all
into
his
skull
The
Council
were
very
nice
continued
Fflewddur
Taliesin
the
Chief
Bard
himself
presented
with
this
harp
said
was
exactly
what
needed
sometimes
wonder
was
really
doing
favor
very
nice
harp
but
have
such
trouble
with
the
strings
throw
away
and
get
another
but
has
beautiful
tone
should
never
find
one
good
only
the
beastly
strings
They
seem
break
frequently
Eilonwy
began
Yes
that
Fflewddur
admitted
little
sheepishly
noticed
usually
happens
when
well
emotional
sort
fellow
and
get
carried
away
might
readjust
the
facts
slightly
purely
for
dramatic
effect
you
understand
you
stop
readjusting
the
facts
quite
much
Eilonwy
said
perhaps
you
wouldn
have
that
trouble
with
the
harp
Yes
suppose
said
the
bard
with
sigh
try
but
hard
very
hard
king
you
get
into
the
habit
Sometimes
think
pass
more
time
fixing
strings
than
playing
But
there
You
can
have
everything
Where
were
you
journeying
when
Achren
captured
you
Taran
asked
place
particular
said
Fflewddur
That
one
advantage
You
don
have
hurry
get
somewhere
You
keep
moving
and
next
thing
you
know
there
you
are
Unfortunately
this
case
was
Achren
dungeon
She
didn
care
for
playing
That
woman
has
ear
for
music
added
shuddering
Sire
Taran
said
ask
boon
Please
said
the
former
king
Fflewddur
will
very
well
boon
Delighted
haven
done
any
boon
granting
since
gave
throne
Fflewddur
Fflam
and
Eilonwy
seated
themselves
the
turf
while
Taran
recounted
his
search
for
Hen
Wen
and
what
Gwydion
had
told
him
the
Horned
King
and
the
rising
the
cantrevs
Gurgi
having
finished
his
meal
sidled
over
and
squatted
hillock
listen
There
doubt
mind
Taran
went
the
Sons
Don
must
have
news
the
uprising
before
the
Horned
King
strikes
triumphs
Arawn
will
have
Prydain
the
throat
have
seen
with
own
eyes
what
that
means
felt
ill
ease
speaking
himself
were
war
leader
council
hall
but
soon
the
words
began
come
easier
Perhaps
thought
because
was
speaking
for
Gwydion
see
your
plan
Fflewddur
interrupted
You
shall
keep
looking
for
your
pig
and
you
want
warn
the
warriors
Don
Splendid
shall
start
off
immediately
And
the
hosts
the
Horned
King
overtake
The
bard
slashed
and
thrust
the
air
They
shall
know
the
valor
Fflam
Taran
shook
his
head
shall
journey
Caer
Dathyl
myself
not
question
your
valor
said
the
bard
but
the
danger
too
great
ask
one
else
face
stead
When
you
intend
seek
your
pig
asked
Fflewddur
own
quest
said
Taran
looking
the
bard
must
given
possible
after
the
first
task
done
mean
return
Until
then
serve
only
Gwydion
was
who
cost
him
his
life
and
justice
for
what
believe
would
have
done
grasp
the
situation
said
the
bard
think
you
taking
too
much
blame
yourself
You
had
way
knowing
Gwydion
wasn
the
dungeon
changes
nothing
Taran
answered
have
made
decision
Fflewddur
was
about
protest
but
the
firmness
Taran
words
silenced
the
bard
After
moment
asked
What
your
boon
then
twofold
said
Taran
First
tell
how
may
reach
Caer
Dathyl
quickly
possible
Second
beg
you
conduct
this
girl
safely
her
own
people
Before
Fflewddur
could
open
his
mouth
Eilonwy
gave
indignant
cry
and
leaped
her
feet
Conducted
shall
conducted
where
please
not
going
sent
back
just
can
sent
somewhere
else
and
will
another
dreary
place
you
can
sure
shall
Caer
Dathyl
too
There
risk
enough
Taran
declared
without
having
worry
about
girl
Eilonwy
put
her
hands
her
hips
Her
eyes
flashed
don
like
being
called
girl
and
this
girl
didn
have
name
all
like
having
your
head
put
sack
you
made
your
decision
made
own
don
see
how
you
going
stop
you
she
hurried
pointing
the
bard
try
conduct
mean
stupid
kinsmen
and
they
hardly
related
the
first
place
that
harp
will
pieces
around
your
ears
Fflewddur
blinked
and
clutched
his
harp
protectively
while
Eilonwy
went
And
certain
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
won
even
mention
his
name
thinks
otherwise
even
more
mistaken
Everyone
started
talking
once
Stop
cried
Taran
the
top
his
voice
Very
well
said
after
the
others
grew
quiet
You
said
Eilonwy
could
tied
and
set
Melyngar
But
added
raising
his
hand
before
the
girl
could
interrupt
that
will
not
done
Not
because
all
the
commotion
you
raised
but
because
realize
now
best
The
bard
looked
surprised
Taran
continued
There
greater
safety
greater
numbers
Whatever
happens
there
will
more
chance
for
one
reach
Caer
Dathyl
believe
should
all
stay
together
And
faithful
Gurgi
too
shouted
Gurgi
will
follow
Too
many
wicked
enemies
are
smirking
and
lurking
jab
him
with
pointy
spears
agrees
Taran
said
Fflewddur
shall
act
guide
But
warn
you
added
glancing
Gurgi
and
Eilonwy
nothing
must
hinder
our
task
Ordinarily
said
Fflewddur
prefer
charge
this
type
expedition
myself
But
went
Taran
was
about
protest
since
you
are
acting
for
Lord
Gwydion
accept
your
authority
would
accept
his
bowed
low
Fflam
yours
command
Forward
then
the
bard
cried
And
must
give
battle
Why
carved
way
through
walls
spearmen
Six
harp
strings
broke
once
and
the
others
strained
tautly
they
looked
the
verge
snapping
While
Taran
saddled
Melyngar
the
bard
set
ruefully
work
repairing
his
harp
Chapter
Flight
Through
the
Hills
FIRST
TARAN
OFFERED
let
Eilonwy
ride
Melyngar
but
the
girl
refused
can
walk
well
any
you
she
cried
angrily
that
Taran
made
more
had
learned
wary
the
girl
sharp
tongue
was
agreed
that
the
white
mare
would
carry
the
weapons
taken
from
Spiral
Castle
except
the
sword
Dyrnwyn
which
Eilonwy
had
appointed
herself
guardian
Scratching
the
dirt
with
his
dagger
point
Fflewddur
Fflam
showed
Taran
the
path
intended
follow
The
hosts
the
Horned
King
will
surely
stay
the
Valley
Ystrad
the
easiest
way
for
army
the
march
Spiral
Castle
was
here
added
with
angry
jab
mark
the
spot
west
the
River
Ystrad
Now
the
shortest
road
would
straight
north
over
these
hills
That
the
one
must
take
said
Taran
trying
hard
make
sense
Fflewddur
crisscrossing
lines
Wouldn
recommend
friend
should
passing
little
too
near
Annuvin
Arawn
strongholds
are
close
Spiral
Castle
and
suggest
keep
clear
them
what
believe
should
this:
stay
the
high
ground
the
western
bank
the
Ystrad
can
quite
directly
since
needn
follow
the
valley
itself
That
way
can
avoid
both
Annuvin
and
the
Horned
King
The
four
can
move
faster
than
heavily
armed
warriors
shall
come
out
well
ahead
them
not
too
far
from
Caer
Dathyl
From
there
make
dash
for
and
our
task
done
Fflewddur
straightened
beaming
with
satisfaction
There
you
have
said
wiping
the
dirt
from
his
dagger
brilliant
strategy
own
war
leader
couldn
have
arranged
better
Yes
said
Taran
his
head
still
muddled
with
the
bard
talk
high
ground
and
western
banks
that
sounds
very
reasonable
THEY
DESCENDED
broad
sun
swept
meadow
The
morning
had
turned
bright
and
warm
dew
still
clung
bending
blades
grass
the
head
the
travelers
strode
Fflewddur
stepping
out
briskly
his
long
spindly
shanks
The
harp
jogged
his
back
his
shabby
cloak
was
rolled
over
his
shoulder
Eilonwy
hair
disheveled
the
breeze
the
great
black
sword
slung
behind
her
followed
next
with
Gurgi
immediately
after
many
new
leaves
and
twigs
had
stuck
Gurgi
hair
that
had
begun
look
like
walking
beaver
dam
loped
along
swinging
his
arms
shaking
his
head
from
side
side
moaning
and
muttering
Holding
Melyngar
bridle
Taran
marched
last
line
Except
for
the
weapons
lashed
the
horse
saddle
these
travelers
might
have
been
spring
ramble
Eilonwy
chattered
gaily
now
and
then
Fflewddur
burst
into
snatch
song
Taran
alone
was
uneasy
him
the
bright
morning
felt
deceptively
gentle
the
golden
trees
seemed
cover
dark
shadows
shuddered
even
the
warmth
His
heart
was
troubled
too
watched
his
companions
Caer
Dallben
had
dreamed
being
hero
But
dreaming
had
come
learn
was
easy
and
Caer
Dallben
lives
depended
his
judgment
longed
for
Gwydion
strength
and
guidance
His
own
strength
feared
was
not
equal
his
task
turned
once
for
last
look
the
direction
Spiral
Castle
Gwydion
burial
mound
Over
the
hill
crest
stark
against
the
clouds
rose
two
figures
horseback
Taran
shouted
and
gestured
for
his
companions
take
cover
the
woods
Melyngar
galloped
forward
another
moment
they
were
all
crouching
thicket
The
horsemen
followed
along
the
crest
too
far
away
for
Taran
see
their
faces
clearly
but
from
their
rigid
postures
could
guess
the
livid
features
and
dull
eyes
the
Cauldron
Born
How
long
have
they
been
behind
asked
Fflewddur
Have
they
seen
Taran
looked
cautiously
through
the
screen
leaves
pointed
toward
the
slope
There
your
answer
said
From
the
crest
the
pale
Cauldron
warriors
had
turned
their
horses
toward
the
meadow
and
were
steadily
picking
their
way
down
the
hill
Hurry
ordered
Taran
must
outrun
them
The
group
did
not
return
the
meadow
but
struck
out
across
the
woods
The
appearance
the
Cauldron
Born
now
forced
them
abandon
the
path
Fflewddur
had
chosen
but
the
bard
hoped
they
might
throw
the
warriors
off
the
track
and
circle
back
again
higher
ground
Staying
close
one
another
they
moved
dog
trot
not
daring
stop
even
for
water
The
forest
offered
measure
protection
from
the
sun
but
after
time
the
pace
began
tell
them
Only
Gurgi
did
not
seem
fatigued
uncomfortable
loped
steadily
along
and
the
swarms
midges
and
stinging
insects
could
not
penetrate
his
matted
hair
Eilonwy
who
proudly
insisted
she
enjoyed
running
clung
Melyngar
stirrup
Taran
could
not
sure
how
close
the
warriors
were
knew
the
Cauldron
Born
could
hardly
fail
track
them
sound
nothing
else
for
they
longer
attempted
move
silently
Speed
was
their
only
hope
and
long
after
nightfall
they
pressed
HAD
BECOME
blind
race
into
darkness
under
moon
drowned
heavy
clouds
Invisible
branches
grasped
them
slashed
their
faces
Eilonwy
stumbled
once
and
Taran
pulled
her
her
feet
The
girl
faltered
again
her
head
drooped
Taran
unstrapped
the
weapons
Melyngar
saddle
shared
out
the
burden
with
Fflewddur
and
Gurgi
and
hoisted
the
protesting
Eilonwy
Melyngar
back
She
slumped
forward
her
cheek
pressed
against
the
horse
golden
mane
All
night
they
struggled
through
the
forest
which
grew
denser
the
closer
they
approached
the
Ystrad
valley
the
time
the
first
hesitating
light
day
appeared
even
Gurgi
had
begun
stumble
with
fatigue
and
could
barely
put
one
hairy
foot
front
the
other
Eilonwy
had
fallen
into
slumber
deep
that
Taran
feared
she
was
ill
Her
hair
lay
bedraggled
and
damp
upon
her
forehead
her
face
was
pallid
With
the
bard
help
Taran
lifted
her
from
the
saddle
and
propped
her
against
mossy
bank
When
ventured
unbuckle
the
cumbersome
sword
Eilonwy
opened
one
eye
made
irritated
face
and
pulled
the
blade
away
from
him
with
more
determination
than
had
expected
You
never
understand
things
the
first
time
Eilonwy
murmured
her
grip
firm
the
weapon
But
imagine
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
are
all
alike
told
you
before
you
not
have
and
now
tell
you
for
the
second
time
the
third
fourth
must
have
lost
count
saying
she
wrapped
her
arms
around
the
scabbard
and
dropped
back
sleep
must
rest
here
Taran
said
the
bard
only
little
while
the
moment
groaned
Fflewddur
who
had
stretched
out
full
length
with
his
toes
and
nose
pointing
straight
into
the
air
don
care
who
catches
welcome
Arawn
himself
and
ask
whether
had
any
breakfast
with
him
The
Cauldron
Born
might
have
lost
track
during
the
night
Taran
said
hopefully
but
without
great
conviction
wish
knew
how
far
left
them
behind
left
them
behind
all
Gurgi
brightened
little
Clever
Gurgi
will
know
cried
with
seekings
and
peekings
another
moment
Gurgi
was
halfway
tall
pine
clambered
easily
the
top
and
perched
there
like
enormous
crow
scanning
the
land
the
direction
they
had
traveled
Taran
meanwhile
opened
the
saddlebags
little
food
remained
that
was
hardly
worth
dividing
and
Fflewddur
agreed
give
Eilonwy
the
last
the
provisions
Gurgi
had
scented
food
even
the
top
the
pine
tree
and
came
scuttling
down
snuffling
eagerly
the
prospect
his
crunchings
and
munchings
Stop
thinking
about
eating
for
moment
Taran
cried
What
did
you
see
Two
warriors
are
far
but
Gurgi
sees
them
yes
yes
they
are
riding
full
wickedness
and
fierceness
But
there
time
for
small
crunching
Gurgi
pleaded
very
small
for
clever
valiant
Gurgi
There
are
more
crunchings
said
Taran
the
Cauldron
Born
are
still
our
heels
you
had
better
worry
less
about
food
and
more
about
your
own
skin
But
Gurgi
will
find
munchings
Very
quickly
yes
wise
get
them
comfort
the
bellies
great
noble
lords
But
they
will
forget
poor
Gurgi
and
not
even
give
him
snips
and
snaps
for
his
eatings
After
hurried
discussion
with
Fflewddur
who
looked
ravenous
Gurgi
Taran
agreed
they
might
take
little
time
search
for
berries
and
edible
roots
Quite
right
said
the
bard
Better
eat
what
can
get
now
while
the
Cauldron
Born
give
chance
shall
help
you
know
all
about
foraging
the
woods
constantly
The
harp
tensed
and
one
string
showed
signs
giving
way
added
quickly
had
better
stay
with
Eilonwy
The
truth
can
tell
mushroom
from
toadstool
wish
could
would
make
the
life
wandering
bard
considerably
more
filling
With
cloaks
which
carry
back
whatever
they
might
find
Taran
and
Gurgi
set
off
small
stream
Taran
halted
fill
Gwydion
leather
water
flask
Gurgi
sniffing
hungrily
ran
ahead
and
disappeared
into
stand
rowans
Near
the
bank
the
stream
Taran
discovered
mushrooms
and
gathered
them
hurriedly
Bent
his
own
search
paid
little
heed
Gurgi
until
suddenly
heard
anguished
yelps
from
behind
the
trees
Clutching
his
precious
mushrooms
Taran
hastened
see
what
had
happened
and
came
upon
Gurgi
lying
the
middle
the
grove
writhing
and
whimpering
honeycomb
beside
him
first
Taran
thought
Gurgi
had
got
himself
stung
bees
Then
saw
the
creature
was
more
serious
trouble
While
Gurgi
had
climbed
for
the
honey
dead
branch
had
snapped
under
his
weight
His
twisted
leg
was
pinned
the
ground
with
the
heavy
wood
top
Taran
heaved
the
branch
away
The
panting
Gurgi
shook
his
head
Poor
Gurgi
leg
broken
moaned
There
will
more
amblings
and
ramblings
for
him
now
Taran
bent
and
examined
the
injury
The
leg
was
not
broken
though
badly
torn
and
swelling
rapidly
Now
Gurgi
head
must
chopped
off
the
creature
moaned
great
lord
quickly
Gurgi
will
squeeze
his
eyes
not
see
hurtful
slashings
Taran
looked
closely
Gurgi
The
creature
was
earnest
His
eyes
pleaded
with
Taran
Yes
yes
cried
Gurgi
Now
before
silent
warriors
arrive
Gurgi
better
dead
your
sword
than
their
hands
Gurgi
cannot
walk
All
will
killed
with
fearful
smitings
and
bitings
better
said
Taran
You
won
left
the
woods
and
you
won
have
your
head
chopped
off
anyone
else
For
moment
Taran
almost
regretted
his
words
The
poor
creature
was
right
knew
The
injury
would
slow
their
pace
And
Gurgi
like
all
them
would
better
off
dead
than
Arawn
grasp
Still
Taran
could
not
bring
himself
draw
his
sword
You
and
Eilonwy
can
ride
Melyngar
Taran
said
lifting
Gurgi
his
feet
and
putting
one
the
creature
hairy
arms
about
his
shoulder
Come
now
One
step
time
Taran
was
exhausted
when
they
reached
Eilonwy
and
the
bard
The
girl
had
recovered
noticeably
and
was
chattering
even
faster
than
before
While
Gurgi
lay
silently
the
grass
Taran
divided
the
honeycomb
The
portions
were
pitifully
small
Fflewddur
called
Taran
aside
Your
hairy
friend
going
make
things
difficult
said
quietly
Melyngar
carries
two
riders
don
know
how
much
longer
she
can
keep
That
true
said
Taran
Yet
see
nothing
else
can
Would
you
abandon
him
Would
you
have
cut
off
his
head
Absolutely
cried
the
bard
flash
Fflam
never
hesitates
Fortunes
war
and
all
that
drat
and
blast
There
goes
another
string
thick
one
too
When
Taran
went
back
rearrange
the
weapons
they
would
now
obliged
bear
was
surprised
find
large
oak
leaf
the
ground
before
his
cloak
the
leaf
lay
Gurgi
tiny
portion
honeycomb
For
great
lord
murmured
Gurgi
Gurgi
not
hungry
for
crunchings
and
munchings
today
Taran
looked
the
eager
face
Guru
For
the
first
time
they
smiled
one
another
Your
gift
generous
Taran
said
softly
but
you
travel
one
and
you
will
need
all
your
strength
Keep
your
share
yours
right
and
you
have
more
than
earned
put
his
hand
gently
Gurgi
shoulder
The
wet
wolfhound
odor
did
not
seem
objectionable
before
Chapter
The
Wolves
FOR
TIME
DURING
THE
DAY
Taran
believed
they
had
last
outdistanced
the
Cauldron
Born
But
late
that
afternoon
the
warriors
reappeared
from
behind
distant
fringe
trees
Against
the
westering
sun
the
long
shadows
the
horsemen
reached
across
the
hill
slope
toward
the
flatlands
where
the
small
troop
struggled
onward
must
stand
against
them
sooner
later
Taran
said
wiping
his
forehead
Let
now
There
can
victory
over
the
Cauldron
Born
but
with
luck
can
hold
them
off
little
while
Eilonwy
and
Gurgi
can
escape
there
still
chance
Gurgi
draped
over
Melyngar
saddle
immediately
set
great
outcry
Faithful
Gurgi
stays
with
mighty
lord
who
spared
his
poor
tender
head
Happy
grateful
Gurgi
will
fight
too
with
slashings
and
gashings
appreciate
your
sentiments
said
Fflewddur
but
with
that
leg
yours
you
hardly
slashing
gashing
anything
all
not
going
run
either
Eilonwy
put
tired
running
and
having
face
scratched
and
robe
torn
all
account
those
stupid
warriors
She
jumped
lightly
from
the
saddle
and
snatched
bow
and
handful
arrows
from
Taran
pack
Eilonwy
Stop
Taran
cried
These
are
deathless
men
They
cannot
killed
Although
encumbered
the
long
sword
hanging
from
her
shoulder
Eilonwy
ran
faster
than
Taran
the
time
caught
with
her
she
had
climbed
hillock
and
was
stringing
the
bow
The
Cauldron
Born
galloped
across
the
plain
The
sun
glinted
their
drawn
swords
Taran
seized
the
girl
the
waist
and
tried
pull
her
away
received
sharp
kick
the
shins
Must
you
always
interfere
with
everything
Eilonwy
asked
indignantly
Before
Taran
could
reach
for
her
again
she
held
arrow
toward
the
sun
and
murmured
strange
phrase
She
nocked
the
arrow
and
loosed
the
direction
the
Cauldron
Born
The
shaft
arched
upward
and
almost
disappeared
against
the
bright
rays
Open
mouthed
Taran
watched
while
the
shaft
began
its
descent:
the
arrow
plummeted
earth
long
silvery
streamers
sprang
from
its
feathers
instant
huge
spiderweb
glittered
the
air
and
drifted
slowly
toward
the
horsemen
Fflewddur
who
had
run
just
then
stopped
amazement
Great
Belin
exclaimed
What
that
looks
like
decorations
for
feast
The
web
slowly
settled
over
the
Cauldron
Born
but
the
pallid
warriors
paid
heed
They
spurred
their
mounts
onward
the
strands
the
web
broke
and
melted
away
Eilonwy
clapped
hand
her
mouth
didn
work
she
cried
almost
tears
The
way
Achren
does
she
makes
into
big
sticky
rope
all
gone
wrong
tried
listen
behind
the
door
when
she
was
practicing
but
missed
something
important
She
stamped
her
foot
and
turned
away
Take
her
from
here
Taran
called
the
bard
unsheathed
his
sword
and
faced
the
Cauldron
Born
Within
moments
they
would
upon
him
But
even
braced
himself
for
their
onslaught
saw
the
horsemen
falter
The
Cauldron
Born
reined
suddenly
then
without
gesture
turned
their
horses
and
rode
silently
back
toward
the
hills
worked
worked
after
all
cried
the
astonished
Fflewddur
Eilonwy
shook
her
head
she
said
with
discouragement
something
turned
them
away
but
afraid
wasn
spell
She
unstrung
the
bow
and
picked
the
arrows
she
had
dropped
think
know
what
was
Taran
said
They
are
returning
Arawn
Gwydion
told
they
could
not
stay
long
from
Annuvin
Their
power
must
have
been
waning
ever
since
left
Spiral
Castle
and
they
reached
the
limit
their
strength
right
here
hope
they
don
have
enough
left
get
back
Annuvin
Eilonwy
said
hope
they
fall
into
pieces
shrivel
like
bats
doubt
that
they
will
Taran
said
watching
the
horsemen
slowly
disappear
over
the
ridge
They
must
know
how
long
they
can
stay
and
how
far
they
can
and
still
return
their
master
gave
Eilonwy
admiring
glance
doesn
matter
They
gone
And
that
was
one
the
most
amazing
things
ever
seen
Gwydion
had
mesh
grass
that
burst
into
flame
but
never
met
anyone
else
who
could
make
web
like
that
Eilonwy
looked
him
surprise
Her
cheeks
blushed
brighter
than
the
sunset
Why
Taran
Caer
Dallben
she
said
think
that
the
first
polite
thing
you
said
Then
suddenly
Eilonwy
tossed
her
head
and
sniffed
course
should
have
known
was
the
spiderweb
You
were
more
interested
that
you
didn
care
whether
was
danger
She
strode
haughtily
back
Gurgi
and
Melyngar
But
that
not
true
Taran
called
was
then
Eilonwy
was
out
earshot
Crestfallen
Taran
followed
her
can
make
sense
out
that
girl
said
the
bard
Can
you
Never
mind
Fflewddur
said
aren
really
expected
That
night
they
continued
take
turns
standing
guard
though
much
their
fear
had
lifted
since
the
Cauldron
Born
had
vanished
Taran
was
the
last
watch
before
dawn
and
was
awake
well
before
Eilonwy
had
ended
You
had
better
sleep
Taran
told
her
finish
the
watch
for
you
perfectly
able
own
share
said
Eilonwy
who
had
not
stopped
being
irritated
him
since
the
afternoon
Taran
knew
better
than
insist
picked
his
bow
and
quiver
arrows
stood
near
the
dark
trunk
oak
and
looked
out
across
the
moon
silvered
meadow
Nearby
Fflewddur
snored
heartily
Gurgi
whose
leg
had
shown
improvement
stirred
restlessly
and
whimpered
his
sleep
You
know
Taran
began
with
embarrassed
hesitation
that
spiderweb
don
want
hear
any
more
about
retorted
Eilonwy
what
meant
was:
really
was
worried
about
you
But
the
web
surprised
much
forgot
mention
was
courageous
you
stand
against
the
Cauldron
warriors
just
wanted
tell
you
that
You
took
long
enough
getting
around
said
Eilonwy
tone
satisfaction
her
voice
But
imagine
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
tend
slower
than
what
you
might
expect
probably
comes
from
the
kind
work
they
Don
misunderstand
think
awfully
important
Only
the
sort
thing
you
don
often
need
quick
about
first
Taran
went
thought
would
able
reach
Caer
Dathyl
myself
see
now
that
wouldn
have
got
even
this
far
without
help
good
destiny
that
brings
such
brave
companions
There
you
done
again
Eilonwy
cried
heatedly
that
Fflewddur
choked
one
his
snores
That
all
you
care
about
Someone
help
you
carry
spears
and
swords
and
what
all
could
anybody
and
you
just
pleased
Taran
Caer
Dallben
not
speaking
you
any
more
home
Taran
said
himself
for
Eilonwy
had
already
pulled
cloak
over
her
head
and
was
feigning
sleep
nothing
ever
happened
Now
everything
happens
But
somehow
can
never
seem
make
come
out
right
With
sigh
held
his
bow
ready
and
began
his
turn
guard
Daylight
was
long
coming
the
morning
Taran
saw
Gurgi
leg
was
much
worse
and
left
the
camp
site
search
the
woods
for
healing
plants
glad
that
Coll
had
taught
him
the
properties
herbs
made
poultice
and
set
Gurgi
wound
Fflewddur
meanwhile
had
begun
drawing
new
maps
with
his
dagger
The
Cauldron
warriors
explained
the
bard
had
forced
the
companions
too
deeply
into
the
Ystrad
valley
Returning
their
original
path
would
cost
them
least
two
days
hard
travel
Since
this
far
Fflewddur
went
might
just
well
cross
Ystrad
and
follow
along
the
hills
staying
out
sight
the
Horned
King
only
few
days
from
Caer
Dathyl
and
keep
good
pace
should
reach
just
time
Taran
agreed
the
new
plan
would
realized
more
difficult
but
judged
Melyngar
could
still
carry
the
unfortunate
Gurgi
long
the
companions
shared
the
burden
the
weapons
Eilonwy
having
forgotten
she
was
not
speaking
Taran
again
insisted
walking
day
march
brought
them
the
banks
the
Ystrad
Taran
stole
cautiously
ahead
Looking
down
the
broad
valley
saw
moving
dust
cloud
When
hurried
back
and
reported
this
Fflewddur
the
bard
clapped
him
the
shoulder
ahead
them
said
That
excellent
news
was
afraid
they
much
closer
and
have
wait
for
nightfall
cross
Ystrad
saved
half
day
Hurry
now
and
into
the
foothills
Eagle
Mountains
before
sundown
With
his
precious
harp
held
above
his
head
Fflewddur
plunged
into
the
river
and
the
others
followed
Here
Ystrad
ran
shallow
scarcely
above
Eilonwy
waist
and
the
companions
forded
with
little
difficulty
Nevertheless
they
emerged
cold
and
dripping
and
the
setting
sun
neither
dried
nor
warmed
them
Leaving
the
Ystrad
behind
the
companions
climbed
slopes
steeper
and
rockier
than
any
they
had
traveled
before
Perhaps
was
only
his
imagination
but
the
air
the
land
around
Spiral
Castle
had
seemed
Taran
heavy
and
oppressive
Approaching
the
Eagle
Mountains
Taran
felt
his
burden
lighten
inhaled
the
dry
spicy
scent
pine
had
planned
continue
the
march
throughout
most
the
night
but
Gurgi
condition
had
worsened
obliging
Taran
call
halt
Despite
the
herbs
Gurgi
leg
was
badly
inflamed
and
shivered
with
fever
looked
thin
and
sad
the
suggestion
crunchings
and
munchings
could
not
rouse
him
Even
Melyngar
showed
concern
Gurgi
lay
with
his
eyes
half
closed
his
parched
lips
tight
against
his
teeth
the
white
mare
nuzzled
him
delicately
whinnying
and
blowing
out
her
breath
anxiously
attempting
comfort
him
best
she
could
Taran
risked
lighting
small
fire
and
Fflewddur
stretched
Gurgi
out
beside
While
Eilonwy
held
the
suffering
creature
head
and
gave
him
drink
from
the
leather
flask
Taran
and
the
bard
moved
little
away
and
spoke
quietly
between
themselves
have
done
all
know
Taran
said
there
anything
else
lies
beyond
skill
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
has
failed
badly
today
and
there
little
him
left
believe
could
pick
him
with
one
hand
Caer
Dathyl
not
far
away
said
Fflewddur
but
our
friend
fear
may
not
live
see
That
night
wolves
howled
the
darkness
beyond
the
fire
ALL
NEXT
DAY
the
wolves
followed
them
sometimes
silently
sometimes
barking
signal
one
another
They
remained
always
out
bow
shot
but
Taran
caught
sight
the
lean
gray
shapes
flickering
and
out
the
scrubby
trees
long
they
don
come
any
closer
said
the
bard
needn
worry
about
them
they
won
attack
Fflewddur
answered
Not
now
any
rate
They
can
infuriatingly
patient
they
know
someone
wounded
turned
anxious
glance
toward
Gurgi
For
them
just
matter
waiting
Well
must
say
you
cheerful
one
remarked
Eilonwy
You
sound
all
had
look
forward
was
being
gobbled
they
attack
shall
stand
them
off
Taran
said
quietly
Gurgi
was
willing
give
his
life
for
can
less
for
him
Above
all
must
not
lose
heart
close
the
end
our
journey
Fflam
never
loses
heart
cried
the
bard
Come
wolves
what
have
you
Nevertheless
uneasiness
settled
over
the
companions
the
gray
shapes
continued
trailing
them
and
Melyngar
docile
and
obedient
until
now
turned
skittish
The
golden
maned
horse
tossed
her
head
and
rolled
her
eyes
every
attempt
lead
her
make
matters
worse
Fflewddur
declared
their
progress
through
the
hills
was
too
slow
any
farther
east
said
the
bard
run
into
some
really
high
mountains
The
condition
couldn
possibly
climb
them
But
here
practically
walled
Every
path
has
led
roundabout
The
cliffs
there
went
pointing
toward
the
towering
mass
rock
his
left
are
too
rugged
get
over
had
thought
find
pass
before
now
Well
that
the
way
can
only
keep
bearing
north
much
possible
The
wolves
don
seem
have
any
trouble
finding
their
way
said
Eilonwy
dear
girl
answered
the
bard
with
some
indignation
were
able
run
four
legs
and
sniff
dinner
mile
away
doubt
have
any
difficulties
either
Eilonwy
giggled
love
see
you
try
she
said
have
someone
who
can
run
four
legs
Taran
said
suddenly
Melyngar
anyone
can
find
their
way
Caer
Dathyl
she
can
The
bard
snapped
his
fingers
That
cried
Every
horse
knows
its
way
home
worth
trying
and
can
worse
off
than
are
now
For
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
said
Eilonwy
Taran
you
come
with
some
interesting
ideas
now
and
then
When
the
companions
started
off
again
Taran
dropped
the
bridle
and
gave
Melyngar
her
head
With
the
half
conscious
Gurgi
bound
her
saddle
the
white
horse
trotted
swiftly
ahead
determined
gait
mid
afternoon
Melyngar
discovered
one
pass
which
Fflewddur
admitted
himself
would
have
overlooked
the
day
wore
Melyngar
led
them
swiftly
through
rocky
defiles
high
ridges
was
all
the
companions
could
keep
with
her
When
she
cantered
into
long
ravine
Taran
lost
sight
her
for
moment
and
hurried
forward
time
glimpse
the
mare
she
turned
sharply
around
outcropping
white
stone
Calling
the
bard
and
Eilonwy
follow
quickly
Taran
ran
ahead
stopped
suddenly
his
left
high
shelf
rock
crouched
enormous
wolf
with
golden
eyes
and
lolling
red
tongue
Before
Taran
could
draw
his
sword
the
lean
animal
sprang
Chapter
The
Hidden
Valley
THE
IMPACT
THE
HEAVY
furry
body
caught
Taran
full
the
chest
and
sent
him
tumbling
fell
caught
glimpse
Fflewddur
The
bard
too
had
been
borne
earth
under
the
paws
another
wolf
Eilonwy
still
stood
though
third
animal
crouched
front
her
Taran
hand
flew
his
sword
The
gray
wolf
seized
his
arm
The
animal
teeth
however
did
not
sink
into
his
flesh
but
held
him
unshakeable
grip
the
end
the
ravine
huge
robed
figure
suddenly
appeared
Melyngar
stood
behind
him
The
man
raised
his
arm
and
spoke
command
Immediately
the
wolf
holding
Taran
relaxed
his
jaws
and
drew
away
obediently
dog
The
man
strode
toward
Taran
who
scrambled
his
feet
You
have
saved
our
lives
Taran
began
are
grateful
The
man
spoke
again
the
wolves
and
the
animals
crowded
around
him
whining
and
wagging
their
tails
was
strange
looking
figure
broad
and
muscular
with
the
vigor
ancient
but
sturdy
tree
His
white
hair
reached
below
his
shoulders
and
his
beard
hung
his
waist
Around
his
forehead
wore
narrow
band
gold
set
with
single
blue
jewel
From
these
creatures
said
deep
voice
that
was
stern
but
not
unkind
your
lives
were
never
danger
But
you
must
leave
this
place
not
abode
for
the
race
men
were
lost
Taran
said
had
been
following
our
horse
Melyngar
The
man
turned
pair
keen
gray
eyes
Taran
Under
his
deep
brow
they
sparkled
like
frost

Melyngar
brought
four
you
understood
young
Gurgi
was
alone
all
means
then
you
are
friends
Melyngar
Melyngar
isn
She
looks
much
like
her
mother
and
there
are
many
cannot
always
keep
track
the
names
know
who
you
are
cried
Taran
You
are
Medwyn
now
the
man
answered
with
smile
that
furrowed
his
face
Yes
have
been
called
Medwyn
But
how
should
you
know
that
Taran
Caer
Dallben
Gwydion
Prince
Don
was
companion
and
spoke
you
before
before
his
death
was
journeying
Caer
Dathyl

now
never
hoped
find
you
You
were
quite
right
Medwyn
answered
You
could
not
have
found
Only
the
animals
know
valley
Melyngar
led
you
here
Taran
you
say
Caer
Dallben
put
enormous
hand
his
forehead
Let
see
Yes
there
are
visitors
from
Caer
Dallben
sure
Taran
heart
leaped
Hen
Wen
cried
Medwyn
gave
him
puzzled
glance
Were
you
seeking
her
Now
that
curious
she
not
here
But
had
thought
will
speak
Hen
Wen
later
said
Medwyn
Your
friend
badly
injured
you
know
Come
shall
what
can
for
him
motioned
for
them
follow
The
wolves
padded
silently
behind
Taran
Eilonwy
and
the
bard
Where
Melyngar
waited
the
end
the
ravine
Medwyn
lifted
Gurgi
from
the
saddle
the
creature
weighed
more
than
squirrel
Gurgi
lay
quietly
Medwyn
arms
The
group
descended
narrow
footpath
Medwyn
strode
ahead
slowly
and
powerfully
tree
were
walking
The
old
man
feet
were
bare
but
the
sharp
stones
and
pebbles
did
not
trouble
him
The
path
turned
abruptly
then
turned
again
Medwyn
passed
through
cut
bare
shoulder
the
cliff
and
the
next
thing
Taran
knew
they
suddenly
emerged
into
green
sunlit
valley
Mountains
seemingly
impassable
rose
all
sides
Here
the
air
was
gentler
without
the
tooth
the
wind
the
grass
spread
rich
and
tender
before
him
Set
among
tall
hemlocks
were
low
white
cottages
not
unlike
those
Caer
Dallben
the
sight
them
Taran
felt
pang
homesickness
Against
the
face
the
slope
behind
the
cottages
saw
what
appeared
first
rows
moss
covered
tree
trunks
looked
his
surprise
they
seemed
more
like
the
weather
worn
ribs
and
timbers
long
ship
The
earth
covered
them
almost
entirely
grass
and
meadow
flowers
had
sprung
obliterate
them
further
and
make
them
part
the
mountain
itself
must
say
the
old
fellow
well
tucked
away
here
whispered
Fflewddur
could
never
have
found
the
path
and
doubt
could
find
the
path
out
Taran
nodded
The
valley
was
the
most
beautiful
had
ever
seen
Cattle
grazed
peacefully
the
meadow
Near
the
hemlocks
small
lake
caught
the
sky
and
sparkled
blue
and
white
The
bright
plumage
birds
flashed
among
the
trees
Even
stepped
across
the
lush
green
the
turf
Taran
felt
exhaustion
drain
from
his
aching
body
There
fawn
Eilonwy
cried
with
delight
From
behind
the
cottages
speckled
long
legged
fawn
appeared
sniffed
the
air
then
trotted
quickly
toward
Medwyn
The
graceful
creature
paid
attention
the
wolves
but
frisked
gaily
the
old
man
side
The
animal
drew
shyly
away
from
the
strangers
but
her
curiosity
got
the
better
her
and
soon
she
was
nuzzling
Eilonwy
hand
never
seen
fawn
this
close
said
the
girl
Achren
never
had
any
pets
none
that
would
stay
with
her
any
rate
can
blame
them
all
This
one
lovely
makes
you
feel
all
tingly
you
were
touching
the
wind
Medwyn
motioning
for
them
wait
carried
Gurgi
into
the
largest
the
cottages
The
wolves
sat
their
haunches
and
watched
the
travelers
through
slanted
eyes
Taran
unsaddled
Melyngar
who
began
cropping
the
tender
grass
Half
dozen
chickens
clucked
and
pecked
around
neat
white
henhouse
The
rooster
raised
his
head
show
notched
comb
Those
are
Dallben
chickens
cried
Taran
They
must
There
the
brown
hen
the
white
know
that
comb
anywhere
hurried
over
and
clucked
them
The
chickens
more
interested
eating
paid
little
attention
Medwyn
reappeared
the
doorway
carried
enormous
wicker
basket
laden
with
jugs
milk
with
cheese
honeycombs
and
fruits
that
the
lowlands
would
not
season
for
another
month
shall
look
after
your
friend
directly
said
Meantime
thought
you
might
enjoy
yes
you
found
them
have
you
said
noticing
Taran
with
the
chickens
Those
are
visitors
from
Caer
Dallben
There
should
swarm
bees
too
somewhere
about
They
flew
away
Taran
said
the
same
day
Hen
Wen
ran
off
Then
imagine
they
came
straight
here
Medwyn
said
The
chickens
were
petrified
with
fright
could
make
sense
all
out
them
they
settled
down
quickly
enough
but
course
that
time
they
had
forgotten
why
they
flew
off
the
first
place
You
know
how
chickens
are
imagining
the
world
coming
end
one
moment
then
pecking
corn
the
next
They
shall
all
fly
back
when
they
ready
have
fear
Though
unfortunate
Dallben
and
Coll
should
put
out
the
matter
eggs
would
ask
you
inside
Medwyn
continued
but
the
disorder
the
moment
there
were
bears
breakfast
and
you
can
imagine
the
state
things
must
ask
you
attend
yourselves
you
would
rest
there
straw
the
byre
should
not
too
uncomfortable
for
you
The
travelers
lost
time
helping
themselves
Medwyn
provisions
finding
the
byre
The
sweet
scent
hay
filled
the
low
ceilinged
building
They
scooped
out
nests
the
straw
uncovering
one
Medwyn
breakfast
guests
curled
and
fast
asleep
Fflewddur
first
uneasy
was
finally
convinced
the
bear
had
appetite
for
bards
and
soon
began
snoring
Eilonwy
dropped
off
sleep
the
middle
one
her
sentences
Taran
had
desire
rest
Medwyn
valley
had
refreshed
him
more
than
night
slumber
left
the
byre
and
strolled
across
the
meadow
the
far
side
the
lake
otters
had
built
slide
and
were
amusing
themselves
tumbling
down
Taran
approach
they
stopped
for
moment
raised
their
heads
look
him
though
sorry
was
unable
join
them
and
returned
their
game
fish
broke
water
twinkle
silver
scales
the
ripples
widened
until
the
last
them
lapped
gently
the
shore
Medwyn
Taran
saw
had
gardens
both
flowers
and
vegetables
behind
the
cottage
his
surprise
Taran
found
himself
yearning
work
with
Coll
his
own
vegetable
plot
The
weeding
and
hoeing
had
despised
Caer
Dallben
now
seemed
thought
his
past
journey
and
the
journey
yet
come
infinitely
pleasant
sat
down
the
rim
the
lake
and
looked
across
the
hills
With
the
sun
resting
above
the
peaks
the
wooden
skeleton
the
great
ship
stood
out
sharply
against
the
mound
which
nearly
enveloped
had
little
chance
study
for
Medwyn
appeared
walking
deliberately
across
the
field
the
fawn
trotted
beside
him
the
three
wolves
followed
With
his
brown
robe
and
white
hair
Medwyn
looked
broad
and
solid
snow
capped
mountain
Gurgi
more
comfortable
than
was
the
ancient
man
said
his
deep
voice
The
fawn
danced
the
lake
shore
while
Medwyn
ponderously
sat
down
and
leaned
his
huge
head
toward
Taran
will
recover
well
there
longer
any
danger
Not
least
while
here
have
thought
long
Gurgi
Taran
said
looking
frankly
into
the
old
man
gray
eyes
explained
then
the
reason
for
his
journey
and
the
events
leading
Gurgi
accident
Medwyn
listened
carefully
head
cocked
one
side
thoughtful
while
Taran
recounted
Gurgi
willingness
sacrifice
his
own
life
rather
than
endanger
the
others
first
wasn
too
fond
him
Taran
admitted
Now
begun
like
him
spite
all
his
whining
and
complaining
Every
living
thing
deserves
our
respect
said
Medwyn
knitting
his
shaggy
brows
humble
proud
ugly
beautiful
wouldn
want
say
that
about
the
gwythaints
Taran
answered
feel
only
sorrow
for
those
unhappy
creatures
Medwyn
said
Once
long
ago
they
were
free
other
birds
gentle
and
trusting
his
cunning
Arawn
lured
them
him
and
brought
them
under
his
power
built
the
iron
cages
which
are
now
their
prison
house
Annuvin
The
tortures
inflicted
the
gwythaints
were
shameful
and
unspeakable
Now
they
serve
him
out
terror
Thus
would
strive
corrupt
every
animal
Prydain
less
than
the
race
men
That
one
the
reasons
remain
this
valley
Here
Arawn
cannot
harm
them
Even
were
become
ruler
this
land
doubt
could
help
them
all
Those
who
fell
into
his
clutches
would
counted
fortunate
they
perished
quickly
Taran
nodded
understand
more
and
more
why
must
warn
the
Sons
Don
for
Gurgi
wonder
wouldn
safer
for
him
stay
here
Safer
asked
Medwyn
Yes
certainly
But
you
would
hurt
him
grievously
were
you
turn
him
away
now
Gurgi
misfortune
that
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
the
moment
has
lost
the
wisdom
animals
and
has
not
gained
the
learning
men
Therefore
both
shun
him
Were
something
purposeful
would
mean
much
him
doubt
will
delay
your
journey
for
will
able
walk
well
you
tomorrow
easily
urge
you
take
him
may
even
find
his
own
way
serving
you
Neither
refuse
give
help
when
needed
Medwyn
continued
nor
refuse
accept
when
offered
Gwythyr
Son
Greidawl
learned
that
from
lame
ant
you
know
lame
ant
Taran
shook
his
head
Dallben
has
taught
much
about
ants
but
nothing
lame
one
long
history
Medwyn
said
and
perhaps
you
will
hear
all
another
time
For
the
moment
you
need
only
know
that
when
Kilhuch
was
his
father
was
young
Kilhuch
Very
well
When
young
Kilhuch
sought
the
hand
the
fair
Olwen
was
given
number
tasks
her
father
Yspadadden
was
Chief
Giant
the
time
What
the
tasks
were
does
not
concern
now
except
that
they
were
very
nigh
impossible
and
Kilhuch
could
not
have
accomplished
them
without
the
aid
his
companions
One
the
tasks
was
gather
nine
bushels
flax
seed
though
there
was
scarcely
that
much
all
the
land
For
the
sake
his
friend
Gwythyr
Son
Greidawl
undertook
this
While
was
walking
over
the
hills
wondering
how
might
accomplish
heard
grievous
wailing
from
anthill
fire
had
started
around
and
the
ants
were
danger
their
lives
Gwythyr
yes
quite
sure
was
Gwythyr
drew
his
sword
and
beat
out
the
fire
gratitude
the
ants
combed
every
field
until
they
had
collected
the
nine
bushels
Yet
the
Chief
Giant
picky
and
disagreeable
sort
claimed
the
measure
was
not
complete
One
flax
seed
was
missing
and
must
delivered
before
nightfall
Gwythyr
had
idea
where
could
find
another
flax
seed
but
last
just
the
sun
had
begun
set
hobbled
lame
ant
carrying
heavy
burden
was
the
single
flax
seed
and
the
last
measure
was
filled
have
studied
the
race
men
Medwyn
continued
have
seen
that
alone
you
stand
weak
reeds
lake
You
must
learn
help
yourselves
that
true
but
you
must
also
learn
help
one
another
Are
you
not
all
you
lame
ants
Taran
was
silent
Medwyn
put
his
hand
into
the
lake
and
stirred
the
water
After
moment
venerable
salmon
rippled
Medwyn
stroked
the
jaws
the
huge
fish
What
place
this
Taran
finally
asked
hushed
voice
Are
you
indeed
Medwyn
You
speak
the
race
men
you
were
not
one
them
This
place
peace
Medwyn
said
and
therefore
not
suitable
for
men
least
not
yet
Until
hold
this
valley
for
creatures
the
forests
and
the
waters
their
mortal
danger
they
come
they
have
the
strength
and
their
pain
and
grief
you
not
believe
that
animals
know
grief
and
fear
and
pain
The
world
men
not
easy
one
for
them
Dallben
said
Taran
taught
that
when
the
black
waters
flooded
Prydain
ages
ago
Nevvid
Nav
Neivion
built
ship
and
carried
with
him
two
every
living
creature
The
waters
drained
away
the
ship
came
rest
man
knows
where
But
the
animals
who
came
safe
again
into
the
world
remembered
and
their
young
have
never
forgotten
And
here
Taran
said
pointing
toward
the
hillside
see
ship
far
from
water
Gwydion
called
you
Medwyn
but
ask
Medwyn
answered
the
white
bearded
man
for
all
that
name
may
concern
you
That
not
important
now
own
concern
for
Hen
Wen
You
have
seen
nothing
her
then
Medwyn
shook
his
head
What
Lord
Gwydion
said
true:
all
places
Prydain
she
would
have
come
here
first
especially
she
sensed
her
life
danger
But
there
has
been
sign
rumor
Yet
she
would
find
her
way
sooner
later
unless
Taran
felt
chill
ripple
his
heart
Unless
she
has
been
killed
murmured
you
think
that
has
happened
not
know
Medwyn
answered
though
fear
may
Chapter
The
Black
Lake
THAT
NIGHT
MEDWYN
prepared
feast
for
the
travelers
The
disorder
left
the
breakfasting
bears
had
been
cleared
away
The
cottage
was
snug
and
neat
though
even
smaller
than
Caer
Dallben
Taran
could
see
that
Medwyn
was
indeed
unused
entertaining
human
visitors
for
his
table
was
barely
long
enough
seat
them
all
and
for
chairs
had
been
obliged
make
with
benches
and
milking
stools
Medwyn
sat
the
head
the
table
The
fawn
had
gone
sleep
but
the
wolves
crouched
his
feet
and
grinned
happily
the
back
his
chair
perched
gigantic
golden
plumed
eagle
watching
every
movement
with
sharp
unblinking
eyes
Fflewddur
though
still
apprehensive
did
not
allow
his
fear
affect
his
appetite
ate
enough
for
three
without
showing
the
least
sign
becoming
full
But
when
asked
for
another
portion
venison
Medwyn
gave
long
chuckle
and
explained
the
amazed
Fflewddur
was
not
meat
all
but
vegetables
prepared
according
his
own
recipe
course
Eilonwy
told
the
bard
You
wouldn
expect
him
cook
his
guests
would
you
That
would
like
asking
someone
dinner
and
then
roasting
him
Really
think
bards
are
muddled
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
neither
one
you
seems
think
very
clearly
much
welcomed
food
and
the
chance
rest
Taran
was
silent
throughout
the
meal
and
continued
when
retired
his
nest
straw
Until
now
had
never
imagined
Hen
Wen
might
not
alive
had
spoken
again
with
Medwyn
but
the
old
man
could
give
him
assurance
Wakeful
Taran
left
the
byre
and
stood
outside
looking
the
sky
the
clear
air
the
stars
were
blue
white
closer
than
had
ever
seen
them
tried
turn
his
thoughts
from
Hen
Wen
reaching
Caer
Dathyl
was
the
task
had
undertaken
and
that
itself
would
difficult
enough
owl
passed
overhead
silent
ashes
The
shadow
appearing
noiselessly
beside
him
was
Medwyn
Not
asleep
Medwyn
asked
restless
night
way
begin
journey
journey
eager
end
Taran
said
There
are
times
when
fear
shall
not
see
Caer
Dallben
again
not
given
men
know
the
ends
their
journeys
Medwyn
answered
may
that
you
will
never
return
the
places
dearest
you
But
how
can
that
matter
what
you
must
here
and
now
think
said
Taran
longingly
that
knew
were
not
see
own
home
again
would
happy
stay
this
valley
Your
heart
young
and
unformed
Medwyn
said
Yet
read
well
you
are
the
few
would
welcome
here
Indeed
you
may
stay
you
choose
Surely
you
can
entrust
your
task
your
friends
said
Taran
after
long
pause
have
taken
myself
through
own
choice
that
answered
Medwyn
then
you
can
give
through
your
own
choice
From
all
over
the
valley
seemed
Taran
there
came
voices
urging
him
remain
The
hemlocks
whispered
rest
and
peace
the
lake
spoke
sunlight
lingering
its
depths
the
joy
otters
their
games
turned
away
said
quickly
decision
was
made
long
before
this
Then
Medwyn
answered
gently
put
hand
Taran
brow
grant
you
all
that
you
will
allow
grant:
night
rest
Sleep
well
Taran
remembered
nothing
returning
the
byre
falling
asleep
but
rose
the
morning
sunlight
refreshed
and
strengthened
Eilonwy
and
the
bard
had
already
finished
their
breakfast
and
Taran
was
delighted
see
that
Gurgi
had
joined
them
Taran
approached
Gurgi
gave
yelp
joy
and
turned
gleeful
somersaults
joy
cried
Gurgi
ready
for
new
walkings
and
stalkings
yes
And
new
seekings
and
peekings
Great
lords
have
been
kind
happy
jolly
Gurgi
Taran
noticed
Medwyn
had
not
only
healed
the
creature
leg
had
also
given
him
bath
and
good
combing
Gurgi
looked
only
half
twiggy
and
leafy
usual
addition
saddled
Melyngar
Taran
found
that
Medwyn
had
packed
the
saddlebags
with
food
and
had
included
warm
cloaks
for
all
them
The
old
man
called
the
travelers
around
him
and
seated
himself
the
ground
The
armies
the
Horned
King
are
now
day
march
ahead
you
said
but
you
follow
the
paths
shall
reveal
and
move
quickly
you
may
regain
the
time
you
have
lost
even
possible
for
you
reach
Caer
Dathyl
day
perhaps
two
before
them
However
warn
you
the
mountain
ways
are
not
easy
you
prefer
shall
set
you
path
toward
the
valley
Ystrad
once
again
Then
would
following
the
Horned
King
Taran
said
There
would
less
chance
overtaking
him
and
much
danger
too
not
think
the
mountains
are
not
dangerous
Medwyn
said
Though
danger
different
sort
Fflam
thrives
danger
cried
the
bard
Let
the
mountains
the
Homed
King
hosts
fear
neither
not
any
great
extent
added
quickly
shall
risk
the
mountains
Taran
said
For
once
Eilonwy
interrupted
you
decided
the
right
thing
The
mountains
certainly
aren
going
throw
spears
matter
how
dangerous
they
are
really
think
you
improving
Listen
carefully
then
Medwyn
ordered
spoke
his
hands
moved
deftly
the
soft
earth
before
him
molding
tiny
model
the
hills
which
Taran
found
easier
follow
than
Fflewddur
map
scratchings
When
finished
and
the
travelers
gear
and
weapons
were
secured
Melyngar
back
Medwyn
led
the
group
from
the
valley
closely
Taran
observed
each
step
the
way
knew
the
path
Medwyn
valley
would
lost
him
soon
the
ancient
man
left
them
little
while
Medwyn
stopped
Your
path
now
lies
the
north
said
and
here
shall
part
And
you
Taran
Caer
Dallben
whether
you
have
chosen
wisely
you
will
learn
from
your
own
heart
Perhaps
shall
meet
again
and
you
will
tell
Until
then
farewell
Before
Taran
could
turn
and
thank
Medwyn
the
white
bearded
man
disappeared
the
hills
had
swallowed
him
and
the
travelers
stood
themselves
rocky
windswept
plateau
Well
said
Fflewddur
hitching
the
harp
behind
him
somehow
feel
that
meet
any
more
wolves
they
know
friends
Medwyn
THE
FIRST
DAY
MARCH
was
less
difficult
than
Taran
had
feared
This
time
led
the
way
for
the
bard
admitted
after
number
harp
strings
had
snapped
that
had
not
been
able
keep
all
Medwyn
directions
his
head
They
climbed
steadily
until
long
after
the
sun
had
turned
westward
and
though
the
ground
was
rough
and
broken
the
path
Medwyn
had
indicated
lay
dearly
before
them
Mountain
streams
whose
water
ran
cold
and
clear
made
winding
lines
sparkling
silver
they
danced
down
the
slopes
into
the
distant
valley
lands
The
air
was
bracing
yet
with
cold
edge
which
made
the
travelers
grateful
for
the
cloaks
Medwyn
had
given
them
long
cleft
protected
from
the
wind
Taran
signaled
halt
They
had
made
excellent
progress
during
the
day
far
more
than
had
expected
and
saw
reason
exhaust
themselves
forcing
march
during
the
night
Tethering
Melyngar
one
the
stunted
trees
that
grew
the
heights
the
travelers
made
camp
Since
there
was
further
danger
from
the
Cauldron
Born
and
the
hosts
the
Horned
King
moved
far
below
and
the
west
the
group
Taran
deemed
safe
build
fire
Medwyn
provisions
needed
cooking
but
the
blaze
warmed
and
cheered
them
the
night
shadows
drifted
from
the
peaks
Eilonwy
lit
her
golden
sphere
and
set
the
crevice
faulted
rock
Gurgi
who
had
not
uttered
single
moan
groan
during
this
part
the
journey
perched
boulder
and
began
scratching
himself
luxuriously
although
after
Medwyn
washing
and
combing
was
more
through
habit
than
anything
else
The
bard
lean
ever
despite
the
huge
amount
had
eaten
repaired
his
harp
strings
You
been
carrying
that
harp
ever
since
met
you
Eilonwy
said
and
you
never
once
played
That
like
telling
somebody
you
want
talk
them
and
when
they
get
ready
listen
you
don
say
anything
You
hardly
expect
strumming
out
airs
while
those
Cauldron
warriors
were
following
Fflewddur
said
Somehow
didn
think
would
appropriate
But
Fflam
always
obliging
you
really
care
hear
play
added
looking
both
delighted
and
embarrassed
cradled
the
instrument
one
arm
and
almost
before
his
fingers
touched
the
strings
gentle
melody
beautiful
the
curve
the
harp
itself
lifted
like
voice
singing
without
words
Taran
ear
the
melody
had
its
own
words
weaving
supple
thread
among
the
rising
notes
Home
home
they
sang
and
beyond
the
words
themselves
fleeting
could
not
quite
sure
them
were
the
fields
and
orchards
Caer
Dallben
the
gold
afternoons
autumn
and
the
crisp
winter
mornings
with
pink
sunlight
the
snow
Then
the
harp
fell
silent
Fflewddur
sat
with
his
head
bent
close
the
strings
curious
expression
his
long
face
Well
that
was
surprise
said
the
bard
last
had
planned
something
little
more
lively
the
sort
thing
war
leader
always
enjoys
put
bold
frame
mind
you
understand
The
truth
the
matter
admitted
with
slight
tone
discouragement
don
really
know
what
going
come
out
next
fingers
along
but
sometimes
think
this
harp
plays
itself
Perhaps
Fflewddur
continued
that
why
Taliesin
thought
was
doing
favor
when
gave
Because
when
went
the
Council
Bards
for
examination
had
old
pot
one
the
minstrels
had
left
behind
and
couldn
more
than
plunk
out
few
chants
However
Fflam
never
looks
gift
horse
the
mouth
this
case
should
say
harp
was
sad
tune
Eilonwy
said
But
the
odd
thing
about
you
don
mind
the
sadness
like
feeling
better
after
you
had
good
cry
made
think
the
sea
again
though
haven
been
there
since
was
little
girl
this
Taran
snorted
but
Eilonwy
paid
attention
him
The
waves
break
against
the
cliffs
and
churn
into
foam
and
farther
out
far
you
can
see
there
are
the
white
crests
the
White
Horses
Llyr
they
call
them
but
they
really
only
waves
waiting
their
turn
roll
Strange
said
the
bard
personally
was
thinking
own
castle
small
and
drafty
but
would
like
see
again
person
can
have
enough
wandering
you
know
made
think
might
even
settle
down
again
and
try
respectable
sort
king
Caer
Dallben
closer
heart
Taran
said
When
left
never
gave
too
much
thought
Now
think
great
deal
Gurgi
who
had
been
listening
silently
set
long
howl
Yes
yes
soon
great
warriors
will
all
back
their
halls
telling
their
tales
with
laughings
and
chaffings
Then
will
the
fearful
forest
again
for
poor
Gurgi
put
down
his
tender
head
snoozings
and
snorings
Gurgi
Taran
said
promise
bring
you
Caer
Dallben
ever
get
there
myself
And
you
like
and
Dallben
agrees
you
can
stay
there
long
you
want
What
joy
Gurgi
cried
Honest
toiling
Gurgi
extends
thanks
and
best
wishes
yes
fond
obedient
Gurgi
will
work
hard
For
now
obedient
Gurgi
had
better
sleep
Taran
advised
and
should
all
Medwyn
has
put
well
our
way
and
can
take
much
longer
start
again
daybreak
DURING
THE
NIGHT
however
gale
rose
and
morning
drenching
rain
beat
into
the
cleft
Instead
slackening
the
wind
gained
force
and
screamed
over
the
rocks
beat
like
fist
against
the
travelers
shelter
then
pried
with
searching
fingers
seize
and
dash
them
into
the
valley
They
set
out
nevertheless
holding
their
cloaks
before
their
faces
make
matters
worse
the
path
broke
off
entirely
and
sheer
cliffs
loomed
ahead
them
The
rain
stopped
after
the
travelers
had
all
been
soaked
the
skin
but
now
the
rocks
were
slippery
and
treacherous
Even
the
sure
footed
Melyngar
stumbled
once
and
for
breathless
moment
Taran
feared
she
would
lost
The
mountains
swung
half
circle
around
lake
black
and
sullen
below
threatening
clouds
Taran
halted
outcropping
stone
and
pointed
toward
the
hills
the
far
side
the
lake
According
what
Medwyn
told
said
the
bard
should
make
for
that
notch
all
the
way
over
there
But
see
purpose
following
the
mountains
when
can
cut
almost
straight
across
The
lake
shore
flat
least
while
here
getting
practically
impossible
climb
Fflewddur
rubbed
his
pointed
nose
Even
counting
the
time
would
take
down
and
come
again
think
should
save
several
hours
Yes
definitely
believe
worth
trying
Medwyn
didn
say
word
about
crossing
valleys
Eilonwy
put
didn
say
anything
about
cliffs
like
these
answered
Taran
They
seem
nothing
him
lived
here
long
time
For
something
else
again
you
don
listen
what
somebody
tells
you
Eilonwy
remarked
like
putting
your
fingers
your
ears
and
jumping
down
well
For
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
who
done
very
little
traveling
you
suddenly
know
all
about
Who
found
the
way
out
the
barrow
Taran
retorted
decided
cross
the
valley
The
descent
was
laborious
but
once
they
had
reached
level
ground
Taran
felt
all
the
more
convinced
they
would
save
time
Holding
Melyngar
bridle
led
the
group
along
the
narrow
shore
The
lake
reached
closely
the
base
the
hills
obliging
Taran
splash
through
the
shallows
The
lake
realized
was
not
black
reflection
the
sky
the
water
itself
was
dark
flat
and
grim
and
heavy
iron
The
bottom
too
was
treacherous
the
rocks
above
Despite
his
care
Taran
lurched
and
nearly
got
ducking
When
turned
warn
the
others
his
surprise
saw
Gurgi
water
his
waist
and
heading
toward
the
center
the
lake
Fflewddur
and
Eilonwy
were
also
splashing
farther
and
farther
from
land
Don
through
the
water
Taran
called
Keep
the
shore
Wish
could
the
bard
shouted
back
But
stuck
somehow
There
terribly
strong
pull
moment
later
Taran
understood
what
the
bard
meant
unexpected
swell
knocked
him
off
his
feet
and
even
put
out
his
hands
break
his
fall
the
black
lake
sucked
him
down
Beside
him
Melyngar
thrashed
her
legs
and
whinnied
The
sky
spun
overhead
was
pulled
along
like
twig
torrent
Eilonwy
shot
past
him
tried
regain
his
footing
and
catch
her
was
too
late
skimmed
and
bobbed
over
the
surface
The
far
shore
would
stop
them
Taran
thought
struggling
keep
his
head
above
the
waves
roar
filled
his
ears
The
middle
the
lake
was
whirlpool
clutching
and
flinging
him
the
depths
Black
water
closed
over
him
and
knew
was
drowning
Chapter
King
Eiddileg
DOWN
SPUN
battling
for
air
flood
that
broke
upon
him
like
crumbling
mountain
Faster
and
faster
the
waters
bore
him
along
tossing
him
right
and
left
Taran
collided
with
something
what
was
could
not
tell
but
clung
even
his
strength
failed
him
There
was
crash
though
the
earth
had
split
asunder
the
water
turned
foam
and
Taran
felt
himself
dashed
against
unyielding
wall
remembered
nothing
more
When
opened
his
eyes
was
lying
hard
smooth
surface
his
hand
tightly
gripping
Fflewddur
harp
heard
the
rush
water
close
Cautiously
felt
around
him
his
fingers
touched
only
wet
flat
stone
embankment
some
kind
pale
blue
light
shone
high
above
him
Taran
decided
had
come
rest
cave
grotto
raised
himself
and
his
movement
set
the
harp
jangling
Hello
Who
that
voice
echoed
down
the
embankment
Faint
though
was
Taran
recognized
belonging
the
bard
scrambled
his
feet
and
crept
the
direction
the
sound
the
way
tripped
over
form
which
became
suddenly
vocal
and
indignant
You
done
very
well
Taran
Caer
Dallben
with
all
your
short
cuts
What
left
soaked
the
skin
and
can
find
bauble
here
all
wet
course
And
who
knows
what
happened
the
rest
The
golden
light
flared
dimly
reveal
the
dripping
face
Eilonwy
her
blue
eyes
flashing
with
vexation
Gurgi
hairy
sputtering
shadow
rolled
toward
them
poor
tender
head
filled
with
sloshings
and
washings
another
moment
Fflewddur
had
found
them
Melyngar
whinnied
behind
him
thought
heard
harp
down
here
said
couldn
believe
first
Never
expected
see
again
But
Fflam
never
despairs
Quite
stroke
luck
though
never
thought
see
anything
again
Taran
said
handing
the
instrument
Fflewddur
been
washed
into
cave
some
kind
but
not
natural
one
Look
these
flagstones
you
look
Melyngar
Eilonwy
called
you
see
all
our
provisions
are
gone
All
our
weapons
too
thanks
your
precious
short
cut
was
true
The
straps
had
broken
loose
and
the
saddle
had
torn
away
the
whirlpool
Luckily
the
companions
still
had
their
swords
sorry
Taran
said
admit
are
here
through
fault
should
not
have
followed
this
path
but
what
done
done
led
here
and
find
way
out
glanced
around
The
roar
water
came
from
wide
swift
running
canal
The
embankment
itself
was
much
broader
than
had
realized
Lights
various
colors
glowed
the
high
arches
turned
his
companions
again
This
very
curious
seem
deep
underground
but
isn
the
lake
bottom
Before
could
utter
another
word
was
seized
from
behind
and
bag
smelling
strongly
onions
was
jammed
over
his
head
Eilonwy
screamed
then
her
voice
grew
muffled
Taran
was
being
half
pushed
half
pulled
two
directions
once
Gurgi
began
yelping
furiously
Here
Get
that
one
gruff
voice
shouted
Get
him
yourself
Can
you
see
got
hands
full
Taran
struck
out
solid
round
ball
that
must
have
been
someone
head
butted
him
the
stomach
There
were
slapping
noises
filtering
through
the
oniony
darkness
around
him
Those
would
from
Eilonwy
Now
was
pushed
from
behind
propelled
top
speed
while
angry
voices
shouted
him
and
each
other
Hustle
along
there
You
fool
you
didn
take
their
swords
this
came
another
shriek
from
Eilonwy
the
sound
what
might
have
been
kick
then
moment
silence
All
right
let
them
keep
their
swords
You
have
the
blame
letting
them
approach
King
Eiddileg
with
weapons
blind
trot
Taran
was
shoved
through
what
seemed
large
crowd
people
Everyone
was
talking
once
the
noise
was
deafening
After
number
turns
was
thrust
forward
again
heavy
door
snapped
behind
him
the
onion
bag
was
snatched
from
his
head
TARAN
BLINKED
With
Fflewddur
and
Eilonwy
stood
the
center
high
vaulted
chamber
glittering
with
lights
Gurgi
was
nowhere
sight
Their
captors
were
half
dozen
squat
round
stubby
legged
warriors
Axes
hung
from
their
belts
and
each
man
had
bow
and
quiver
arrows
his
shoulder
The
left
eye
the
short
burly
fellow
who
stood
beside
Eilonwy
was
turning
greenish
black
Before
them
long
stone
table
dwarfish
figure
with
bristling
yellow
beard
glared
the
warriors
wore
robe
garish
red
and
green
Rings
sparkled
his
plump
fingers
What
this
shouted
Who
are
these
people
Didn
give
orders
wasn
disturbed
But
Majesty
began
one
the
warriors
shifting
uneasily
caught
them
Must
you
bother
with
details
King
Eiddileg
cried
clasping
his
forehead
You
ruin
You
the
death
Out
Out
not
the
prisoners
you
idiots
Shaking
his
head
sighing
and
sputtering
the
King
collapsed
onto
throne
carved
from
rock
The
guards
scurried
away
King
Eiddileg
shot
furious
glance
Taran
and
his
companions
Now
then
out
with
What
you
want
You
might
well
know
ahead
time
you
shan
have
Sire
Taran
began
ask
more
than
safe
passage
through
your
realm
The
four
There
only
three
you
King
Eiddileg
snapped
Can
you
count
One
companions
missing
Taran
said
regretfully
had
hoped
Gurgi
would
have
overcome
his
fear
but
could
not
blame
the
creature
for
running
off
after
his
ordeal
the
whirlpool
beg
your
servants
help
find
him
Then
too
our
provisions
and
weapons
have
been
lost
That
clotted
nonsense
shouted
the
King
Don
lie
can
stand
pulled
orange
kerchief
from
his
sleeve
and
mopped
his
forehead
Why
did
you
come
here
Because
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
led
wild
goose
chase
Eilonwy
interrupted
don
even
know
where
are
let
alone
why
worse
than
rolling
downhill
the
dark
Naturally
said
Eiddileg
his
voice
dripping
with
sarcasm
You
have
idea
you
the
very
heart
the
Kingdom
Tylwyth
Teg
the
Fair
Folk
the
Happy
Family
the
Little
People
whatever
other
insipid
irritating
names
you
put
course
not
You
just
happened
passing
were
caught
the
lake
Taran
protested
pulled
down
Good
King
Eiddileg
answered
with
quick
smile
pride
added
some
improvements
own
course
you
anxious
keep
visitors
away
Eilonwy
said
you
should
have
something
better
make
people
stay
out
When
people
get
this
close
Eiddileg
answered
they
already
too
close
that
point
don
want
them
out
want
them
Fflewddur
shook
his
head
always
understood
the
Fair
Folk
were
all
over
Prydain
not
just
here
course
not
just
here
said
Eiddileg
with
impatience
This
the
royal
seat
Why
have
tunnels
and
mines
every
place
you
can
imagine
But
the
real
work
the
real
labor
organization
here
right
here
this
very
spot
this
very
throne
room
shoulders
too
much
tell
you
too
much
But
who
else
can
you
trust
you
want
something
done
right
The
King
stopped
suddenly
and
drummed
his
glittering
fingers
the
stone
table
That
not
your
affair
said
You
trouble
enough
can
overlooked
don
see
any
work
being
done
said
Eilonwy
Before
Taran
could
warn
Eilonwy
not
imprudent
the
door
the
throne
room
burst
open
and
crowd
folk
pressed
Looking
closer
Taran
saw
not
all
were
dwarfs
some
were
tall
slender
with
white
robes
others
were
covered
with
glistening
scales
like
fish
still
others
fluttered
large
delicate
wings
For
some
moments
Taran
heard
nothing
but
confusion
voices
angry
outcries
and
bickering
with
Eiddileg
trying
shout
above
them
Finally
the
King
managed
push
them
all
out
again
work
being
done
cried
You
don
appreciate
everything
that
goes
into
The
Children
Evening
that
another
ridiculous
name
you
humans
have
thought
are
sing
the
forest
Cantrev
Mawr
tonight
They
haven
even
practiced
Two
are
sick
and
one
can
found
The
Lake
Sprites
have
been
quarreling
all
day
now
they
sulking
Their
hair
mess
And
who
does
that
reflect
Who
has
jolly
them
along
coax
them
plead
with
them
The
answer
obvious
What
thanks
get
for
King
Eiddileg
ranted
None
all
Has
any
you
long
legged
gawks
ever
taken
the
trouble
even
once
mind
you
offer
the
simplest
expression
gratitude
such
Thank
you
King
Eiddileg
for
the
tremendous
effort
and
inconvenience
you
gone
that
can
enjoy
little
charm
and
beauty
the
world
above
which
would
unspeakably
grim
without
you
and
your
Fair
Folk
Just
few
words
honest
appreciation
means
Just
the
opposite
any
you
thick
skulled
oafs
come
one
the
Fair
Folk
above
ground
what
happens
You
seize
him
You
grab
him
with
your
great
hammy
hands
and
try
make
him
lead
you
buried
treasure
you
squeeze
him
until
you
get
three
wishes
out
him
not
satisfied
with
one
but
three
Well
don
mind
telling
you
this
Eiddileg
went
his
face
turning
redder
the
moment
put
end
all
this
wish
granting
and
treasure
scavenging
more
Absolutely
not
surprised
you
didn
ruin
long
ago
Just
then
chorus
voices
rose
from
behind
the
door
Eiddileg
throne
room
The
harmonies
penetrated
even
the
walls

stone
Taran
had
never
his
life
heard
such
beautiful
singing
listened
enchanted
forgetting
for
the
moment
all
but
the
soaring
melody
Eiddileg
himself
stopped
shouting
and
puffing
until
the
voices
died
away
That
something
thankful
for
the
King
said
last
The
Children
Evening
have
evidently
got
together
again
Not
good
you
might
want
but
they
manage
somehow
have
not
heard
the
songs
the
Fair
Folk
until
now
Taran
said
had
never
realized
how
lovely
they
were
Don
try
flatter
Eiddileg
cried
trying
look
furious
yet
beaming
the
same
time
What
surprises
Eilonwy
said
while
the
bard
plucked
meditatively
his
harp
trying
recapture
the
notes
the
song
why
you
much
trouble
you
Fair
Folk
dislike
all
above
ground
why
you
bother
Professional
pride
dear
girl
said
the
Dwarf
King
putting
chubby
hand
his
heart
and
bowing
slightly
When
Fair
Folk
something
right
yes
sighed
never
mind
the
sacrifices
make
task
that
needs
doing
and
Never
mind
the
cost
For
myself
added
with
wave
his
hand
doesn
matter
lost
sleep
lost
weight
but
that
not
important
King
Eiddileg
had
lost
weight
Taran
thought
himself
what
must
have
been
like
beforehand
decided
against
asking
this
question
Well
appreciate
Eilonwy
said
think
amazing
what
you
been
able
You
must
extremely
clever
and
any
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
who
happen
this
throne
room
might
well
pay
attention
Thank
you
dear
girl
said
King
Eiddileg
bowing
lower
see
you
the
sort
person
one
can
talk
intelligently
unheard
for
one
you
big
shambling
louts
have
any
kind
insight
into
these
matters
But
you
least
seem
understand
the
problems
face
Sire
interrupted
Taran
understand
your
time
precious
Let
disturb
you
more
Give
safe
conduct
Caer
Dathyl
What
shouted
Eiddileg
Leave
here
Impossible
Unheard
Once
you
with
the
Fair
Folk
good
lad
you
stay
and
mistake
about
suppose
could
stretch
point
for
the
sake
the
young
lady
and
let
you
off
easily
Only
put
you
sleep
for
fifty
years
turn
you
all
into
bats
but
that
would
pure
favor
mind
you
Our
task
urgent
Taran
cried
Even
now
have
delayed
too
long
That
your
concern
not
mine
Eiddileg
shrugged
Then
shall
make
our
own
way
Taran
shouted
drawing
his
sword
Fflewddur
blade
leaped
out
and
the
bard
stood
with
Taran
ready
fight
More
clotted
nonsense
King
Eiddileg
said
looking
contemptuously
the
swords
pointed
toward
him
shook
his
fingers
them
There
And
there
Now
you
might
try
move
your
arms
Taran
strained
every
muscle
His
body
felt
turned
stone
Put
your
swords
away
and
let
talk
this
over
calmly
said
the
Dwarf
King
gesturing
again
you
give
any
decent
reason
why
should
let
you
might
think
over
and
answer
you
promptly
say
year
two
There
could
use
Taran
saw
concealing
the
reasons
for
his
journey
explained
Eiddileg
what
had
befallen
them
The
Dwarf
King
ceased
his
blustering
the
mention
Arawn
but
when
Taran
had
finished
King
Eiddileg
shook
his
head
This
conflict
you
great
gawks
must
attend
yourselves
The
Fair
Folk
owe
you
allegiance
said
angrily
Prydain
belonged
before
the
race
men
came
You
drove
underground
You
plundered
our
mines
you
blundering
clodpoles
You
stole
our
treasures
and
you
keep
stealing
them
you
clumsy
oafs
Sire
Taran
answered
can
speak
for
man
but
myself
have
never
robbed
you
and
have
wish
task
means
more
than
your
treasures
there
ill
will
between
the
Fair
Folk
and
the
race
men
then
matter
settled
between
them
But
the
Horned
King
triumphs
the
shadow
Annuvin
falls
the
land
above
you
Arawn
hand
will
reach
your
deepest
caverns
For
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
said
Eiddileg
you
reasonably
eloquent
But
the
Fair
Folk
will
worry
about
Arawn
when
the
time
comes
The
time
has
come
Taran
said
only
hope
has
not
passed
don
think
you
really
know
what
going
above
ground
Eilonwy
suddenly
exclaimed
You
talk
about
charm
and
beauty
and
sacrificing
yourself
make
things
pleasant
for
people
don
believe
you
care
bit
for
that
You
too
conceited
and
stubborn
and
selfish
Conceited
shouted
Eiddileg
his
eyes
popping
Selfish
You
won
find
anyone
more
openhearted
and
generous
How
dare
you
say
that
What
you
want
life
blood
With
that
tore
off
his
cloak
and
threw
the
air
pulled
the
rings
from
his
fingers
and
tossed
them
every
direction
ahead
Take
all
Leave
ruined
What
else
you
want
whole
kingdom
you
want
leave
all
means
The
sooner
the
better
Stubborn
too
soft
will
the
death
But
little
you
care
that
moment
the
door
the
throne
room
burst
open
again
Two
dwarf
warriors
clung
frantically
Gurgi
who
swung
them
about
they
were
rabbits
Joyous
greetings
Faithful
Gurgi
back
with
mighty
heroes
This
time
valiant
Gurgi
did
not
run
Brave
Gurgi
fought
with
great
whackings
and
smackings
triumphed
But
then
mighty
lords
are
carried
away
Clever
Gurgi
goes
seeking
and
peeking
save
them
yes
And
finds
them
But
that
not
all
faithful
honest
fearless
Gurgi
finds
more
Surprises
and
delights
joy
Gurgi
was
excited
that
began
dancing
one
foot
spinning
around
and
clapping
his
hands
Mighty
warriors
seek
piggy
clever
wise
Gurgi
who
finds
her
Hen
Wen
cried
Taran
Where
she
Here
mighty
lord
Gurgi
shouted
the
piggy
here
Chapter
Doli
TARAN
TURNED
ACCUSINGLY
King
Eiddileg
You
said
nothing
Hen
Wen
You
didn
ask
said
Eiddileg
That
sharp
practice
Fflewddur
muttered
even
for
king
worse
than
lie
Taran
said
angrily
You
have
let
our
way
and
never
have
known
what
happened
her
You
should
ashamed
yourself
Eilonwy
put
shaking
her
finger
the
King
who
appeared
most
embarrassed
being
found
out
like
looking
the
other
way
when
someone
about
walk
into
hole
Finders
keepers
the
Dwarf
King
snapped
troop
the
Fair
Folk
came
her
near
the
Avren
banks
She
was
running
through
ravine
And
tell
you
something
you
don
know
Half
dozen
warriors
were
after
her
the
henchmen
the
Horned
King
The
troop
took
care
those
warriors
have
our
own
ways
dealing
with
you
clumsy
lummoxes
and
they
brought
your
pig
here
underground
most
the
way
wonder
Gwydion
could
find
tracks
Taran
murmured
himself
The
Fair
Folk
rescued
her
Eiddileg
angrily
continued
turning
bright
red
and
there
another
fine
example
get
word
thanks
Naturally
not
But
get
called
disagreeable
names
and
have
nasty
thoughts
thrown
can
see
your
faces
Eiddileg
thief
and
wretch
that
what
you
saying
yourselves
Well
just
for
that
you
shan
have
her
back
And
you
stay
here
all
you
until
feel
like
letting
you
Eilonwy
gasped
with
indignation
you
that
she
cried
you
are
thief
and
wretch
You
gave
your
word
The
Fair
Folk
don
back
their
word
There
was
mention
pig
mention
all
Eiddileg
clapped
his
hands
over
his
paunch
and
snapped
his
mouth
shut
Taran
said
there
was
not
But
there
question
honesty
and
honor
Eiddileg
blinked
and
looked
sideways
took
out
his
orange
kerchief
and
mopped
his
brow
again
Honor
muttered
yes
was
afraid
you
come
that
True
the
Fair
Folk
never
break
their
word
Well
sighed
that
the
price
for
being
openhearted
and
generous
You
shall
have
your
pig
shall
need
weapons
replace
those
lost
Taran
said
What
screamed
Eiddileg
Are
you
trying
ruin
And
crunchings
and
munchings
piped
Gurgi
Taran
nodded
Provisions
well
This
going
too
far
Eiddileg
shouted
You
bleeding
death
Weapons
Food
Pigs
And
beg
for
guide
who
will
show
the
way
Caer
Dathyl
this
Eiddileg
nearly
exploded
When
finally
calmed
himself
nodded
reluctantly
shall
lend
you
Doli
said
the
only
one
can
spare
clapped
his
hands
and
gave
orders
the
armed
dwarfs
then
turned
the
companions
Off
with
you
now
before
change
mind
Eilonwy
stepped
quickly
the
throne
bent
and
kissed
Eiddileg
the
top
his
head
Thank
you
she
whispered
you
perfectly
lovely
king
Out
Out
the
dwarf
cried
the
stone
door
closed
behind
him
Taran
saw
King
Eiddileg
fondling
his
head
and
beaming
happily
The
troop
Fair
Folk
led
the
company
down
the
vaulted
corridors
Taran
had
first
imagined
Eiddileg
realm
more
than
maze
underground
galleries
his
astonishment
the
corridors
soon
broadened
into
wide
avenues
the
great
domes
far
overhead
gems
glittered
bright
sunshine
There
was
grass
but
deep
carpets
green
lichen
stretched
out
like
meadows
There
were
blue
lakes
glistening
much
the
jewels
above
and
cottages
and
small
farmhouses
was
difficult
for
Taran
and
his
companions
realize
they
were
underground
been
thinking
whispered
Fflewddur
that
might
wiser
leave
Hen
Wen
here
until
can
return
for
her
thought
that
too
answered
Taran
not
that
don
trust
Eiddileg
keep
his
word
most
the
time
But
not
sure
should
take
another
chance
that
lake
and
doubt
could
find
another
way
into
his
kingdom
certainly
won
make
easy
for
come
back
afraid
must
take
Hen
Wen
while
have
the
chance
Once
she
with
again
won
let
her
out
sight
Suddenly
the
Fair
Folk
halted
one
the
cottages
and
from
neatly
carpentered
pen
Taran
heard
loud
Hwoinch
raced
the
sty
Hen
Wen
was
standing
with
her
front
feet
the
rails
grunting
the
top
her
voice
One
the
Fair
Folk
opened
the
gate
and
the
white
pig
burst
out
wriggling
and
squealing
Taran
threw
his
arms
around
Hen
Wen
neck
Hen
cried
Even
Medwyn
thought
you
were
dead
Hwch
Hwaaw
Hen
Wen
chuckled
joyfully
Her
beady
eyes
sparkled
With
her
great
pink
snout
she
rooted
affectionately
under
Taran
chin
and
came
close
knocking
him
down
She
looks
like
wonderful
pig
Eilonwy
said
scratching
Hen
Wen
behind
the
ears
always
nice
see
two
friends
meet
again
like
waking
with
the
sun
shining
She
certainly
great
deal
pig
agreed
the
bard
though
very
handsome
must
say
And
clever
noble
brave
wise
Gurgi
found
her
Have
fear
Taran
said
with
smile
Gurgi
there
chance
forget
Rolling
and
waddling
her
short
legs
Hen
Wen
followed
Taran
happily
while
the
Fair
Folk
proceeded
across
the
fields
where
stocky
figure
waited
The
captain
the
troop
announced
that
this
was
Doli
the
guide
Eiddileg
had
promised
Doli
short
and
stumpy
almost
broad
was
tall
wore
rust
colored
leather
jacket
and
stout
knee
high
boots
round
cap
covered
his
head
but
not
enough
conceal
fringe
flaming
red
hair
axe
and
short
sword
hung
from
his
belt
and
over
his
shoulder
wore
the
stubby
bow
the
Fair
Folk
warrior
Taran
bowed
politely
The
dwarf
stared
him
with
pair
bright
red
eyes
and
snorted
Then
Taran
surprise
Doli
took
deep
breath
and
held
until
his
face
turned
scarlet
and
looked
about
burst
After
few
moments
the
dwarf
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
snorted
again
What
the
trouble
asked
Taran
You
can
still
see
can
you
Doli
burst
out
angrily
course
can
still
see
you
Taran
frowned
Why
shouldn
Doli
gave
him
scornful
look
and
did
not
answer
Two
the
Fair
Folk
led
Melyngar
King
Eiddileg
Taran
saw
with
relief
was
good
his
word
The
saddlebags
bulged
with
provisions
and
the
white
mare
also
carried
number
spears
bows
and
arrows
short
and
heavy
were
all
the
weapons
the
Fair
Folk
but
carefully
and
sturdily
crafted
Without
another
word
Doli
beckoned
them
follow
him
across
the
meadow
Grumbling
and
muttering
himself
the
dwarf
led
them
what
seemed
the
sheer
face
cliff
Only
after
had
reached
did
Taran
see
long
flights
steps
carved
into
the
living
rock
Doli
jerked
his
head
toward
the
stairway
and
they
began
climb
This
passageway
the
Fair
Folk
was
steeper
than
any
the
mountains
they
had
crossed
Melyngar
strained
forward
Wheezing
and
gasping
Hen
Wen
pulled
herself
each
step
The
stairway
turned
and
twisted
one
point
the
darkness
was
such
that
the
companions
lost
sight
each
other
After
time
the
steps
broke
off
and
the
group
trod
narrow
pathway
hard
packed
stones
Sheets
white
light
rippled
ahead
and
the
travelers
found
themselves
behind
high
waterfall
One
after
the
other
they
leaped
the
glistening
rocks
splashed
through
foaming
stream
and
last
emerged
into
the
cool
air
the
hills
Doli
squinted
the
sun
Not
much
daylight
left
muttered
more
gruffly
than
King
Eiddileg
himself
Don
think
going
walk
legs
off
all
night
either
Didn
ask
for
this
work
you
know
Got
picked
for
Guiding
crew
what
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
yellow
headed
idiot
with
harp
girl
with
sword
shaggy
what
Not
mention
the
livestock
All
you
can
hope
for
you
don
run
into
real
war
band
They
for
you
they
would
There
not
one
you
looks
could
handle
blade
Humph
This
was
the
most
Doli
had
spoken
since
they
had
left
Eiddileg
realm
and
despite
the
dwarf
uncomplimentary
opinions
Taran
hoped
would
finally
come
around
being
civil
Doli
however
had
said
all
intended
say
for
while
later
when
Taran
ventured
speak
him
the
dwarf
turned
angrily
away
and
started
holding
his
breath
again
For
goodness
sake
Eilonwy
cried
wish
you
stop
that
makes
feel
drunk
too
much
water
just
watching
you
still
doesn
work
Doli
growled
Whatever
are
you
trying
Taran
asked
Even
Hen
Wen
stared
curiously
the
dwarf
What
does
look
like
Doli
answered
trying
make
myself
invisible
That
odd
thing
attempt
remarked
Fflewddur
supposed
invisible
snapped
Doli
whole
family
can
Just
like
that
Like
blowing
out
candle
But
not
wonder
they
all
laugh
wonder
Eiddileg
sends
out
with
pack
fools
there
anything
nasty
disagreeable
done
always
find
good
old
Doli
there
gems
cut
blades
decorated
arrows
footed
that
the
job
for
good
old
Doli
The
dwarf
held
his
breath
again
this
time
long
that
his
face
turned
blue
and
his
ears
trembled
think
you
getting
now
said
the
bard
with
encouraging
smile
can
see
you
all
sooner
had
this
remark
passed
his
lips
than
harp
string
snapped
two
Fflewddur
looked
sorrowfully
the
instrument
Blast
the
thing
muttered
knew
was
exaggerating
somewhat
only
did
make
him
feel
better
actually
did
seem
fading
bit
around
the
edges
could
carve
gems
and
all
those
other
things
Taran
remarked
sympathetically
Doli
wouldn
mind
not
being
invisible
All
know
vegetables
and
horseshoes
and
not
too
much
about
either
silly
Eilonwy
added
worry
because
you
can
something
you
simply
can
That
worse
than
trying
make
yourself
taller
standing
your
head
None
these
well
intentioned
remarks
cheered
the
dwarf
who
strode
angrily
ahead
swinging
his
axe
from
side
side
Despite
his
bad
temper
Doli
was
excellent
guide
Taran
realized
Most
the
time
the
dwarf
said
little
beyond
his
usual
grunts
and
snorts
making
attempt
explain
the
path
followed
suggest
how
long
would
take
the
companions
reach
Caer
Dathyl
Taran
nevertheless
had
learned
great
deal
woodcraft
and
tracking
during
his
journey
and
was
aware
the
companions
had
begun
turning
westward
descend
the
hills
They
had
during
the
afternoon
covered
more
ground
than
Taran
thought
possible
and
knew
was
thanks
Doli
expert
guidance
When
congratulated
the
dwarf
Doli
answered
only
Humph
and
held
his
breath
They
camped
that
night
the
sheltered
slope
the
last
barrier
mountains
Gurgi
whom
Taran
had
taught
build
fire
was
delighted
useful
cheerfully
gathered
twigs
dug
cooking
pit
and
the
surprise
all
distributed
the
provisions
equally
without
saving
out
private
share
for
his
own
crunchings
and
munchings
later
Doli
refused
anything
whatsoever
took
his
own
food
from
large
leather
wallet
hanging
his
side
and
sat
rock
chewing
glumly
snorted
with
annoyance
between
every
mouthful
and
occasionally
held
his
breath
Keep
old
boy
called
Fflewddur
Another
try
might
Your
outline
looks
definitely
blurred
hush
Eilonwy
told
the
bard
Don
encourage
him
decide
hold
his
breath
forever
Just
lending
support
explained
the
crestfallen
bard
Fflam
never
gives
and
don
see
why
dwarf
should
Hen
Wen
had
not
left
Taran
side
all
day
Now
spread
his
cloak
the
ground
the
white
pig
grunted
with
pleasure
waddled
over
and
hunkered
down
beside
him
Her
crinkled
ears
relaxed
she
thrust
her
snout
comfortably
against
Taran
shoulder
and
chuckled
contentedly
blissful
smile
her
face
Soon
the
whole
weight
her
head
pressed
him
making
impossible
for
Taran
roll
onto
his
side
Hen
Wen
snored
luxuriously
and
Taran
resigned
himself
sleeping
despite
the
assortment
whistles
and
groans
directly
below
his
ear
glad
see
you
Hen
said
and
glad
you
glad
see
But
wish
you
wouldn
loud
about
NEXT
MORNING
they
turned
their
backs
the
Eagle
Mountains
and
began
heading
for
what
Taran
hoped
would
Caer
Dathyl
the
trees
rose
more
densely
around
them
Taran
turned
for
last
glimpse
the
Eagle
itself
tall
and
serene
the
distance
was
grateful
their
path
had
not
led
them
over
but
his
heart
hoped
one
day
return
and
climb
its
towers
sun
flecked
ice
and
black
stone
Until
this
journey
had
never
seen
mountains
but
now
understood
why
Gwydion
had
spoken
longingly
Caer
Dathyl
His
thought
led
Taran
wonder
again
what
else
Gwydion
had
expected
learn
from
Hen
Wen
When
they
halted
spoke
Fflewddur
about
There
may
someone
Caer
Dathyl
who
can
understand
her
Taran
said
But
could
only
get
her
prophesy
now
she
might
tell
something
important
The
bard
agreed
however
Taran
had
pointed
out
they
had
letter
sticks
could
try
new
spell
offered
Eilonwy
Achren
taught
some
others
but
don
know
they
any
use
They
haven
anything
with
oracular
pigs
know
wonderful
one
for
summoning
toads
Achren
was
about
teach
the
spell
for
opening
locks
but
don
suppose
ever
learn
now
Even
locks
haven
much
with
pigs
either
Eilonwy
knelt
beside
Hen
Wen
and
whispered
rapidly
Hen
Wen
seemed
listen
politely
for
while
grinning
broadly
wheezing
and
snuffling
She
gave
sign
understanding
word
what
the
girl
was
saying
and
last
with
joyful
Hwoinch
she
broke
away
and
ran
Taran
wriggling
gleefully
use
Taran
said
and
there
sense
losing
time
hope
they
have
letter
sticks
Caer
Dathyl
Though
doubt
Whatever
Dallben
has
seems
the
only
one
its
kind
all
Prydain
They
resumed
their
march
Gurgi
now
official
cook
and
firemaker
strode
boldly
behind
the
dwarf
Doli
led
the
companions
through
clearing
and
past
line
alders
few
moments
later
the
dwarf
halted
and
cocked
his
head
Taran
heard
the
sound
too:
faint
high
pitched
screaming
seemed
come
from
twisted
thornbush
Drawing
his
sword
Taran
hurried
past
the
dwarf
first
could
see
nothing
the
dark
tangle
drew
closer
then
stopped
abruptly
was
gwythaint
Chapter
The
Fledgling
THE
GWYTHAINT
HUNG
like
crumpled
black
rag
one
wing
upraised
the
other
folded
awkwardly
its
breast
larger
than
raven
was
young
and
barely
out
its
first
moult
the
head
seemed
little
too
big
for
its
body
the
feathers
thin
and
quilly
Taran
cautiously
approached
the
gwythaint
fluttered
vainly
unable
free
itself
The
bird
opened
its
curved
beak
and
hissed
warningly
but
its
eyes
were
dull
and
half
closed
The
companions
had
followed
Taran
soon
Gurgi
saw
what
was
hunched
his
shoulders
and
with
many
fearful
glances
behind
him
turned
and
crept
off
safe
distance
Melyngar
whinnied
nervously
The
white
pig
undisturbed
sat
her
haunches
and
looked
cheerful
Fflewddur
seeing
the
bird
gave
low
whistle
stroke
luck
the
parents
aren
about
said
Those
creatures
will
tear
man
shreds
their
young
are
danger
reminds
Achren
Eilonwy
said
especially
around
the
eyes
days
when
she
was
bad
temper
Doli
pulled
his
axe
from
his
belt
What
are
you
going
Taran
asked
The
dwarf
looked
him
with
surprise
Going
you
have
any
other
stupid
questions
You
can
imagine
let
sit
there
can
you
going
chop
off
its
head
begin
with
cried
Taran
seizing
the
dwarfs
arm
badly
hurt
glad
that
snapped
Doli
weren
neither
you
nor
nor
any
would
standing
here
will
not
have
killed
Taran
declared
pain
and
needs
help
That
true
Eilonwy
said
doesn
look
comfortable
all
For
the
matter
that
looks
even
worse
than
Achren
The
dwarf
threw
his
axe
the
ground
and
put
his
hands
his
hips
can
make
myself
invisible
snorted
but
least
fool
ahead
Pick
the
vicious
little
thing
Give
drink
Pat
its
head
Then
you
see
what
happens
soon
got
strength
enough
the
first
thing
slice
you
bits
And
next
thing
fly
straight
Arawn
Then
fine
stew
What
Doli
says
true
Fflewddur
added
myself
don
enjoy
chopping
things
the
bird
interesting
disagreeable
sort
way
But
been
lucky
far
with
trouble
from
gwythaints
least
don
see
the
use
bringing
one
Arawn
spies
right
into
our
bosom
you
might
say
Fflam
always
kind
hearted
but
seems
this
overdoing
Medwyn
would
not
say
Taran
answered
the
hills
spoke
kindness
for
all
creatures
and
told
much
about
the
gwythaints
think
important
bring
this
one
Caer
Dathyl
one
has
ever
captured
live
gwythaint
far
know
Who
can
tell
what
value
may
have
The
bard
scratched
his
head
Well
yes
suppose
had
any
use
all
would
better
alive
than
dead
But
the
proposition
risky
matter
what
Taran
gestured
for
the
others
stand
away
from
the
bush
saw
the
gwythaint
was
wounded
more
than
thorns
perhaps
eagle
had
challenged
for
blood
flecked
its
back
and
number
feathers
had
been
torn
out
reached
carefully
The
gwythaint
hissed
again
and
long
rasping
rattle
sounded
its
throat
Taran
feared
the
bird
might
dying
even
then
put
hand
under
its
feverish
body
The
gwythaint
struck
with
beak
and
talons
but
its
strength
had
gone
Taran
lifted
free
the
thornbush
can
find
the
right
herbs
make
poultice
Taran
told
Eilonwy
But
need
hot
water
steep
them
While
the
girl
prepared
nest
grass
and
leaves
Taran
asked
Gurgi
build
fire
and
heat
some
stones
which
could
dropped
into
cup
water
Then
with
Hen
Wen
his
heels
quickly
set
out
search
for
the
plants
How
long
are
going
stay
here
Doli
shouted
after
him
Not
that
care
You
the
ones
hurry
not
Humph
thrust
his
axe
into
his
belt
jammed
his
cap
tight
his
head
and
furiously
held
his
breath
Taran
was
again
grateful
for
what
Coll
had
taught
him
herbs
found
most
what
needed
growing
nearby
Hen
Wen
joined
the
hunt
with
enthusiasm
grunting
happily
rooting
under
leaves
and
stones
Indeed
the
white
pig
was
the
first
discover
important
variety
Taran
had
overlooked
The
gwythaint
did
not
struggle
when
Taran
applied
the
poultice
soaking
piece
cloth
torn
from
his
jacket
another
healing
brew
squeezed
the
liquid
drop
drop
into
the
bird
beak
That
all
very
well
said
Doli
whose
curiosity
had
got
the
better
him
and
who
had
come
observe
the
operation
How
you
imagine
you
carry
the
nasty
thing
perched
your
shoulder
don
know
Taran
said
thought
could
wrap
cloak
Doli
snorted
That
the
trouble
with
you
great
clodhoppers
You
don
see
beyond
your
noses
But
you
expect
build
cage
for
you
you
mistaken
cage
would
just
the
thing
Taran
agreed
wouldn
want
bother
you
with
that
try
make
one
myself
The
dwarf
watched
contemptuously
while
Taran
gathered
saplings
and
attempted
weave
them
together
stop
Doli
finally
burst
out
can
stand
looking
botched
work
Here
get
out
the
way
shouldered
Taran
aside
squatted
the
ground
and
picked
the
saplings
trimmed
them
expertly
with
his
knife
lashed
them
with
braided
vines
and
time
all
the
dwarf
held
serviceable
cage
That
certainly
more
practical
than
making
yourself
invisible
Eilonwy
said
The
dwarf
made
answer
and
only
looked
her
angrily
Taran
lined
the
bottom
the
cage
with
leaves
gently
put
the
gwythaint
inside
and
they
resumed
their
march
Doli
now
led
them
faster
pace
make
for
the
time
they
had
lost
tramped
steadily
down
the
hill
slopes
without
even
turning
see
whether
Taran
and
the
others
were
able
keep
with
him
The
speed
their
pace
Taran
realized
served
little
purpose
since
they
were
obliged
halt
more
frequently
But
did
not
deem
wise
mention
this
the
dwarf
Throughout
the
day
the
gwythaint
steadily
improved
each
halt
Taran
fed
the
bird
and
applied
the
medicines
Gurgi
was
still
too
terrified
come
near
Taran
alone
dared
handle
the
creature
When
Fflewddur
endeavoring
make
friends
put
his
finger
into
the
cage
the
gwythaint
roused
and
slashed
him
with
its
beak
warn
you
snapped
Doli
good
will
come
this
But
don
pay
any
attention
what
say
right
ahead
Cut
your
own
throats
Then
come
running
and
complaining
afterward
just
guide
what
ordered
and
that
all
nightfall
they
made
camp
and
discussed
plans
for
the
morrow
The
gwythaint
had
entirely
recovered
and
had
also
developed
enormous
appetite
squawked
furiously
when
Taran
did
not
bring
its
food
quickly
enough
and
rattled
its
beak
against
the
cage
gobbled
the
morsels
Taran
gave
then
looked
around
for
more
After
eating
the
gwythaint
crouched
the
bottom
the
cage
its
head
cocked
and
listening
its
eyes
following
every
movement
Taran
finally
ventured
put
finger
past
the
bars
and
scratch
the
gwythaint
head
The
creature
longer
hissed
and
made
attempt
bite
him
The
gwythaint
even
allowed
Eilonwy
feed
but
the
bard
attempts
make
friends
failed
knows
perfectly
well
you
have
agreed
chop
off
its
head
Eilonwy
told
Fflewddur
you
can
blame
the
poor
thing
for
being
annoyed
you
somebody
wanted
chop
off
head
then
came
around
afterward
and
wanted
sociable
peck
them
too
Gwydion
told
the
birds
are
trained
when
young
Taran
said
wish
were
here
would
know
best
how
handle
the
creature
Perhaps
could
taught
differently
But
there
bound
good
falconer
Caer
Dathyl
and
see
what
can
But
the
next
morning
the
cage
was
empty
Doli
who
had
risen
long
before
the
others
was
the
first
discover
The
furious
dwarf
thrust
the
cage
under
Taran
nose
The
sapling
bars
had
been
slashed
pieces
the
gwythaint
beak
And
there
you
have
cried
Doli
told
you
Don
say
didn
warn
you
The
treacherous
creature
halfway
Annuvin
now
after
listening
every
word
said
Arawn
didn
know
where
are
know
soon
enough
You
done
well
very
well
Doli
snorted
Spare
from
fools
and
Assistant
Pig
Keepers
Taran
could
not
hide
his
disappointment
fear
Fflewddur
said
nothing
but
the
bard
face
was
grim
done
the
wrong
thing
again
usual
Taran
said
angrily
Doli
right
There
difference
between
fool
and
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
That
probably
true
agreed
Eilonwy
whose
remark
did
nothing
cheer
Taran
But
she
went
can
stand
people
who
say
told
you
That
worse
than
somebody
coming
and
eating
your
dinner
before
you
have
chance
sit
down
Even
she
added
Doli
means
well
not
half
disagreeable
pretends
and
sure
worried
about
like
porcupine
all
prickly
the
outside
but
very
ticklish
once
you
turn
him
over
only
stop
trying
make
himself
invisible
think
should
lot
improve
his
disposition
There
was
time
for
further
regrets
Doli
set
them
even
swifter
pace
They
still
followed
the
hills
along
the
Ystrad
valley
but
midday
the
dwarf
turned
west
and
once
more
began
descend
toward
the
plains
The
sky
had
grown
thick
and
gray
lead
Violent
gusts
wind
whipped
their
faces
The
pale
sun
gave
warmth
Melyngar
neighed
uneasily
Hen
Wen
placid
and
agreeable
until
now
began
roll
her
eyes
and
mutter
herself
While
the
companions
rested
briefly
Doli
went
ahead
scout
the
land
short
time
was
back
again
led
them
the
crest
hill
motioned
them
stay
close
the
ground
and
pointed
toward
the
Ystrad
below
The
plain
was
covered
with
warriors
foot
and
horseback
Black
banners
snapped
the
wind
Even
this
distance
Taran
could
hear
the
clank
weapons
the
steady
heavy
drumming
marching
feet
the
head
the
winding
columns
rode
the
Horned
King
The
giant
figure
towered
above
the
men
arms
who
galloped
behind
him
The
curving
antlers
rose
like
eager
claws
Taran
watched
terrified
but
unable
turn
away
the
Horned
King
head
swung
slowly
the
direction
the
heights
Taran
pressed
flat
against
the
earth
Arawn
champion
was
sure
could
not
see
him
was
only
trick
his
mind
mirror
his
own
fear
but
seemed
the
Horned
King
eyes
sought
him
out
and
thrust
like
daggers
his
heart
They
have
overtaken
Taran
said
flat
voice
Hurry
snapped
the
dwarf
Get
hustling
instead
dawdling
and
moaning
more
than
day
away
from
Caer
Dathyl
and
are
they
can
still
move
faster
you
hadn
stopped
for
that
ungrateful
spy
Annuvin
well
ahead
them
now
Don
say
didn
warn
you
should
arm
ourselves
little
better
the
bard
said
The
Horned
King
will
have
outriders
both
sides
the
valley
Taran
unstrapped
the
weapons
Melyngar
back
and
handed
bow
and
quiver
arrows
his
companions
well
short
spear
for
each
King
Eiddileg
had
given
them
round
bronze
bucklers
they
were
dwarf
size
and
after
his
view
the
marching
hosts
Taran
found
them
pitifully
small
Gurgi
buckled
short
sword
around
his
waist
all
the
band
was
the
most
excited
Yes
yes
cried
Now
bold
valiant
Gurgi
mighty
warrior
too
has
grinding
gasher
and
pointed
piercer
ready
for
great
fightings
and
smitings
And
Fflewddur
declared
Nothing
withstands
the
onslaught
angry
Fflam
The
dwarf
clapped
his
hands
his
head
and
gnashed
his
teeth
Stop
jabbering
and
move
sputtered
This
time
was
too
furious
hold
his
breath
Taran
slung
the
buckler
over
his
shoulder
Hen
Wen
hung
back
and
grunted
fearfully
know
you
afraid
Taran
whispered
coaxingly
but
you
safe
Caer
Dathyl
The
pig
followed
reluctantly
but
Doli
set
off
once
again
she
lagged
behind
and
was
all
Taran
could
urge
her
forward
Her
pink
snout
trembled
her
eyes
darted
from
one
side
the
path
the
other
the
next
halt
Doli
summoned
Taran
Keep
like
this
cried
and
you
have
chance
all
First

She
frightened
Taran
tried
explain
the
angry
dwarf
She
knows
the
Horned
King
near
Then
tie
her
Doli
said
Put
her
the
horse
Taran
nodded
Yes
She
won
like
but
there
nothing
else
can
few
moments
before
the
pig
had
been
crouched
the
roots
tree
Now
there
was
sign
her
Hen
Taran
called
turned
the
bard
Where
did
she
asked
alarm
The
bard
shook
his
head
Neither
nor
Eilonwy
had
seen
her
move
Gurgi
had
been
watering
Melyngar
and
had
not
noticed
the
pig
all
She
can
have
run
off
again
Taran
cried
raced
back
into
the
woods
When
returned
his
face
was
pale
She
gone
gasped
She
hiding
somewhere
know
sank
the
ground
and
put
his
head
his
hands
shouldn
have
let
her
out
sight
not
even
for
moment
said
bitterly
have
failed
twice
Let
the
others
Eilonwy
said
find
her
and
catch
with
them
Before
Taran
could
answer
heard
sound
that
chilled
his
blood
From
the
hills
came
the
voices
hunting
pack
full
cry
and
the
long
notes
horn
The
companions
stood
frozen
with
dread
With
the
ice
terror
his
throat
Taran
looked
the
silent
faces
around
him
The
dire
music
trembled
the
air
shadow
flickered
across
the
lowering
sky
Where
Gwyn
the
Hunter
rides
murmured
Fflewddur
death

Hoofbeats

cried
Fflewddur
pointing
the
mounted

galloping
toward

They
seen
from

the

over

urging
their

They

Under

saw

the

With

seized

from

Beside

the

had
been
lucky
now
the
shafts
hissed
through
the
air
only
glance
off
the
attackers
light
shields
Behind
Taran
Melyngar
whinnied
and
pawed
the
ground
frantically
Taran
remembered
how
valiantly
she
had
fought
for
Gwydion
but
she
was
tethered
now
and
dared
not
break
away
from
the
defenders
untie
her
The
horsemen
circled
One
turned
his
exposed
side
the
companions
Doli
arrow
leaped
from
the
bowstring
and
buried
itself
the
warrior
neck
The
other
horsemen
spun
their
mounts
and
galloped
across
the
meadow
beaten
them
cried
Eilonwy
That
like
bees
driving
away
eagles
The
panting
Fflewddur
shook
his
head
They
spend
more
men
When
they
come
back
they
come
back
with
war
band
That
highly
complimentary
our
bravery
but
don
think
should
wait
for
them
Fflam
knows
when
fight
and
when
run
this
point
had
better
run
won
leave
Hen
Wen
cried
Taran
look
for
her
growled
Doli
You
lose
your
head
well
your
pig
Crafty
Gurgi
will
suggested
Gurgi
with
bold
seekings
and
peekings
all
likelihood
said
the
bard
they
attack
again
can
afford
lose
what
little
strength
have
Fflam
never
worries
about
being
outnumbered
but
one
sword
less
could
fatal
sure
your
pig
able
look
out
for
herself
wherever
she
may
she
less
danger
than
are
Taran
nodded
true
But
grieves
lose
her
for
the
second
time
had
chosen
abandon
search
and
Caer
Dathyl
then
after
Gurgi
found
Hen
Wen
had
hoped
accomplish
both
tasks
But
fear
must
one
the
other
The
question
said
Fflewddur
there
any
chance
all
warning
the
Sons
Don
before
the
Horned
King
attacks
Doli
the
only
one
who
can
answer
that
The
dwarf
scowled
and
thought
for
few
moments
Possible
said
but
have
into
the
valley
the
middle
the
Horned
King
vanguard
Can
get
through
asked
Taran
Won
know
until
you
tried
grunted
Doli
The
decision
yours
said
the
bard
glancing
Taran
shall
try
Taran
answered
For
the
rest
that
day
they
traveled
without
halt
nightfall
Taran
would
have
been
glad
rest
but
the
dwarf
warned
against
The
companions
pressed
weary
silence
They
had
escaped
the
attack
Fflewddur
expected
but
column
horsemen
bearing
torches
passed
within
bowshot
them
The
companions
crouched
the
fringe
trees
until
the
streaks
flame
wound
behind
hill
and
vanished
short
time
Doli
led
the
little
band
into
the
valley
where
they
found
concealment
the
wooded
groves
But
the
dawn
revealed
sight
that
filled
Taran
with
despair
The
valley
roiled
with
warriors
wherever
turned
his
eyes
Black
banners
whipped
against
the
sky
The
host
the
Horned
King
was
like
the
body
armed
giant
restlessly
stirring
For
moment
Taran
stared
disbelief
turned
his
face
away
Too
late
murmured
Too
late
have
failed
WHILE
THE
DWARF
surveyed
the
marching
columns
Fflewddur
strode
forward
There
one
thing
can
cried
Caer
Dathyl
lies
straight
ahead
Let
and
make
our
last
stand
there
Taran
nodded
Yes
place
the
side
Gwydion
people
Doli
shall
lead
Gurgi
and
Eilonwy
safety
took
deep
breath
and
buckled
his
sword
belt
more
tightly
You
have
guided
well
said
quietly
the
dwarf
Return
your
king
with
our
gratitude
Your
work
done
The
dwarf
looked
him
furiously
Done
snorted
Idiots
and
numbskulls
not
that
care
what
happens
you
but
don
think
going
watch
you
get
hacked
pieces
can
stand
botched
job
Like
not
going
with
you
Before
the
words
were
out
his
mouth
arrow
sang
past
Doli
head
Melyngar
reared
party
foot
soldiers
sprang
from
the
woods
behind
the
companions
Begone
the
bard
shouted
Taran
Ride
fast
you
can
will
death
for
all
When
Taran
hesitated
the
bard
seized
him
the
shoulders
pitched
him
toward
the
horse
and
thrust
Eilonwy
after
him
Fflewddur
drew
his
sword
say
shouted
the
bard
his
eyes
blazing
Taran
leaped
Melyngar
saddle
and
pulled
Eilonwy
behind
him
The
white
horse
shot
forward
Eilonwy
clung
Taran
waist
the
steed
galloped
straight
across
the
bracken
toward
the
vanguard
the
Horned
King
Taran
made
attempt
guide
her
the
horse
had
chosen
her
own
path
Suddenly
was
the
midst
the
warriors
Melyngar
reared
and
plunged
Taran
sword
was
out
and
struck
right
and
left
hand
clutched
the
stirrups
then
was
ripped
away
Taran
saw
the
warrior
stumble
back
and
drown
the
press
struggling
men
The
white
horse
broke
free
and
streaked
for
the
brow
the
hill
One
mounted
figure
galloped
behind
them
now
terrified
glance
Taran
saw
the
sweeping
antlers
the
Horned
King
The
black
steed
gained
them
Melyngar
turned
sharply
and
drove
toward
the
forest
The
Horned
King
turned
with
her
and
they
crashed
through
the
underbrush
and
past
the
first
rows
trees
the
antlered
giant
drew
closer
until
both
steeds
galloped
side
side
final
burst
speed
the
horse
the
Horned
King
plunged
ahead
the
animal
flanks
bore
against
Melyngar
who
reared
furiously
and
struck
out
with
her
hoofs
Taran
and
Eilonwy
were
flung
from
the
saddle
The
Horned
King
turned
his
mount
seeking
trample
them
Taran
scrambled
his
feet
and
struck
blindly
with
his
sword
Then
gripping
Eilonwy
arm
pulled
her
deeper
into
the
protection
the
trees
The
Horned
King
sprang
heavily
the
ground
and
was
upon
them
few
long
strides
Eilonwy
screamed
Taran
swung
about
face
the
antlered
man
Dark
fears
clutched
Taran
though
the
Lord
Annuvin
himself
had
opened
abyss
his
feet
and
was
hurtling
downward
gasped
with
pain
though
his
old
wound
had
opened
once
again
All
the
despair
had
known
Achren
captive
returned
sap
his
strength
Behind
the
bleached
skull
the
eyes
the
Horned
King
flamed
raised
crimson
stained
arm
Blindly
Taran
brought
his
sword
trembled
his
hand
The
Horned
King
blade
lashed
against
the
weapon
and
shattered
with
single
blow
Taran
dropped
the
useless
shards
The
Horned
King
paused
growl
savage
joy
rose
his
throat
and
took
firmer
grasp
his
weapon
Mortal
terror
goaded
Taran
into
action
leaped
back
and
spun
toward
Eilonwy
Dyrnwyn
cried
Give
the
sword
Before
she
could
move
tore
belt
and
weapon
from
her
shoulder
The
Horned
King
saw
the
black
scabbard
and
hesitated
moment
fear
Taran
grasped
the
hilt
The
blade
would
not
come
free
pulled
with
all
his
strength
The
sword
moved
only
little
from
its
sheath
The
Horned
King
raised
his
own
weapon
Taran
gave
final
wrench
the
scabbard
turned
his
hand
blinding
flash
split
the
air
front
him
Lightning
seared
his
arm
and
was
thrown
violently
the
ground
The
sword
Dyrnwyn
blazing
white
with
flame
leaped
from
his
hand
and
fell
beyond
his
reach
The
Horned
King
stood
over
him
With
cry
Eilonwy
sprang
the
antlered
man
Snarling
the
giant
tossed
her
aside
voice
rang
out
behind
the
Horned
King
Through
eyes
blurred
with
pain
Taran
glimpsed
tall
figure
against
the
trees
and
heard
shouted
word
could
not
distinguish
The
Horned
King
stood
motionless
his
arm
upraised
Lightning
played
about
his
sword
The
giant
flamed
like
burning
tree
The
stag
horns
turned
crimson
streaks
the
skull
mask
ran
like
molten
iron
roar
pain
and
rage
rose
from
the
Antlered
King
throat
With
cry
Taran
flung
arm
across
his
face
The
ground
rumbled
and
seemed
open
beneath
him
Then
there
was
nothing
Chapter
The
Secret
SUNLIGHT
STREAMED
THROUGH
the
high
window
chamber
pleasantly
cool
and
fragrant
Taran
blinked
and
tried
lift
himself
from
the
low
narrow
couch
His
head
spun
his
arm
swathed
white
linen
throbbed
painfully
Dry
rushes
covered
the
floor
the
bright
rays
turned
them
yellow
wheat
Beside
the
couch
white
sun
dappled
shape
stirred
and
rose
Hwoinch
Hen
Wen
wheezing
and
chuckling
grinned
all
over
her
round
face
With
joyful
grunt
she
began
nuzzling
Taran
cheek
His
mouth
opened
but
could
not
speak
silvery
laugh
rang
from
comer
the
chamber
You
should
really
see
your
expression
You
look
like
fish
that
climbed
into
bird
nest
mistake
Eilonwy
rose
from
the
osier
stool
was
hoping
you
wake
soon
You
can
imagine
how
boring
sit
and
watch
somebody
sleep
like
counting
stones
wall
Where
have
they
taken
this
Annuvin
Eilonwy
laughed
again
and
shook
her
head
That
exactly
the
sort
question
you
might
expect
from
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
Annuvin
Ugh
wouldn
want
there
all
Why
must
you
always
think
unpleasant
things
suppose
because
your
wound
probably
did
something
your
head
You
looking
lot
better
now
than
you
did
though
you
still
have
that
greenish
white
color
like
boiled
leek
Stop
chattering
and
tell
where
are
Taran
tried
roll
from
the
couch
then
sank
back
weakly
and
put
hand
his
head
You
aren
supposed
get
yet
Eilonwy
cautioned
but
imagine
you
just
discovered
that
for
yourself
Wriggling
and
grunting
loudly
the
delighted
Hen
Wen
had
begun
climb
onto
the
couch
Eilonwy
snapped
her
fingers
Stop
that
Hen
she
ordered
you
know
isn
disturbed
upset
and
especially
not
sat
The
girl
turned
again
Taran
Caer
Dathyl
she
said
lovely
place
Much
nicer
than
Spiral
Castle
Taran
started
once
more
memories
flooded
over
him
The
Horned
King
cried
What
happened
Where
barrow
most
likely
should
think
dead
Naturally
answered
the
girl
You
don
think
stand
being
put
barrow
weren
you
There
wasn
great
deal
left
him
but
what
there
was
got
buried
Eilonwy
shuddered
think
was
the
most
terrifying
person
ever
met
and
that
includes
Achren
gave
dreadful
tossing
about
just
before
was
going
smite
you
She
rubbed
her
head
For
the
matter
that
you
pulled
away
sword
rather
roughly
told
you
and
told
you
not
draw
But
you
wouldn
listen
That
what
burned
your
arm
Taran
noticed
the
black
scabbard
Dyrnwyn
longer
hung
from
Eilonwy
shoulder
But
then
what
lucky
you
went
unconscious
Eilonwy
continued
You
missed
the
worst
There
was
the
earthquake
and
the
Horned
King
burning
until
just
well
broke
apart
wasn
pleasant
The
truth
the
matter
rather
not
talk
about
still
gives
bad
dreams
even
when
not
asleep
Taran
gritted
his
teeth
Eilonwy
said
last
want
you
tell
very
slowly
and
carefully
what
happened
you
don
going
angry
and
you
going
sorry
How
can
tell
you
anything
Eilonwy
said
deliberately
pronouncing
every
word
and
making
extravagant
grimaces
she
did
you
don
want
talk
She
shrugged
Well
any
case
she
resumed
her
usual
breathless
rate
soon
the
armies
saw
the
Horned
King
was
dead
they
practically
fell
apart
too
Not
the
same
way
naturally
With
them
was
more
sort
running
away
like
herd
rabbits
that
isn
right
But
was
pitiful
see
grown
men
frightened
course
that
time
the
Sons
Don
had
their
chance
attack
You
should
have
seen
the
golden
banners
And
such
handsome
warriors
Eilonwy
sighed
was
was
like
don
even
know
what
was
like
And
Hen
Wen
She
hasn
stirred
from
this
chamber
ever
since
they
brought
you
here
said
Eilonwy
Neither
have
she
added
with
glance
Taran
She
very
intelligent
pig
Eilonwy
went
she
does
get
frightened
and
loses
her
head
once
while
suppose
And
she
can
very
stubborn
when
she
wants
which
sometimes
makes
wonder
how
much
difference
there
between
pigs
and
the
people
who
keep
them
not
mentioning
anyone
particular
you
understand
The
door
opposite
Taran
couch
opened
part
way
Around
appeared
the
spiky
yellow
head
and
pointed
nose
Fflewddur
Fflam
you
back
with
cried
the
bard
you
might
say
back
with
you
Gurgi
and
the
dwarf
who
had
been
standing
behind
the
bard
now
rushed
despite
Eilonwy
protests
they
crowded
around
Taran
Fflewddur
and
Doli
showed
sign
injury
but
Gurgi
head
was
bound
and
moved
with
limp
Yes
Yes
cried
Gurgi
fought
for
his
friend
with
slashings
and
gashings
What
smitings
Fierce
warriors
strike
him
about
his
poor
tender
head
but
valiant
Gurgi
does
not
flee
Taran
smiled
him
deeply
touched
sorry
about
your
poor
tender
head
said
putting
hand
Gurgi
shoulder
and
that
friend
should
wounded
for
sake
What
joy
What
clashings
and
smashings
Ferocious
Gurgi
fills
wicked
warriors
with
awful
terror
and
outcries
true
said
the
bard
was
the
bravest
all
Though
stumpy
friend
here
can
surprising
things
with
axe
Doli
for
the
first
time
grinned
Never
thought
any
you
had
any
mettle
show
said
attempting
gruff
Took
you
all
for
milksops
first
Deepest
apologies
added
with
bow
held
off
the
war
band
Fflewddur
said
until
were
sure
you
were
well
away
Some
them
should
have
occasion
think
unkindly
for
while
come
The
bard
face
lit
There
were
cried
fighting
like
madmen
hopelessly
outnumbered
But
Fflam
never
surrenders
took
three
once
Slash
Thrust
Another
seized
from
behind
the
wretched
coward
But
flung
him
off
disengaged
them
and
made
for
Caer
Dathyl
chopping
and
hacking
all
the
way
beset
all
sides
Taran
expected
Fflewddur
harp
strings
sunder
any
moment
his
surprise
they
held
firm
And
Fflewddur
concluded
with
carefree
shrug
that
was
our
part
Rather
easy
when
you
come
down
had
fear
things
going
badly
not
for
instant
string
broke
with
deep
twang
Fflewddur
bent
down
Taran
Terrified
whispered
Absolutely
green
Eilonwy
seized
the
bard
and
thrust
him
toward
the
door
Begone
she
cried
all
you
You
wear
him
out
with
your
chatter
The
girl
shoved
Gurgi
and
the
dwarf
after
Fflewddur
And
stay
out
one
come
until
say
they
can
Not
even
Taran
started
the
familiar
voice
Gwydion
stood
the
doorway
For
moment
Taran
did
not
recognize
him
Instead
the
stained
cloak
and
coarse
jacket
Gwydion
wore
the
shining
raiment
prince
His
rich
mantle
hung
deep
folds
chain
his
throat
gleamed
sun
shaped
disk
gold
His
green
eyes
shone
with
new
depth
and
power
Taran
saw
him
now
had
always
imagined
him
Heedless
his
wounded
arm
Taran
sprang
from
the
couch
The
tall
figure
strode
toward
him
The
authority
the
warrior
bearing
made
Taran
drop
one
knee
Lord
Gwydion
murmured
That
greeting
from
friend
friend
said
Gwydion
gently
raising
Taran
his
feet
gives
more
pleasure
remember
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
who
feared
would
poison
him
the
forest
near
Caer
Dallben
After
Spiral
Castle
Taran
stammered
never
thought
see
you
alive
clasped
Gwydion
hand
and
wept
unashamedly
little
more
alive
than
you
are
Gwydion
smiled
helped
Taran
seat
himself
the
couch
But
how
did
Taran
began

and

Gwydion

Eilonwy
interrupted
She
turned
Gwydion
told
him
not
draw
but
impossibly
stubborn
Fortunately
you
did
not
unsheath
entirely
Gwydion
said
Taran

the

Dyrnwyn
would
have
been
too
great
even
for
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
weapon
power
Eilonwy
recognized
Gwydion
added
ancient
that
believed
more
than
legend
There
are
still
deep
secrets
concerning
Dyrnwyn
unknown
even
the
wisest
Its
loss
destroyed
Spiral
Castle
and
was
severe
blow
Arawn
With
single
firm
gesture
Gwydion
drew
the
blade
and
held
aloft
The
weapon
glittered
blindingly
fear
and
wonder
Taran
shrank
back
his
wound
throbbing
anew
Gwydion
quickly
returned
the
blade
its
scabbard
soon
saw
Lord
Gwydion
Eilonwy
put
with
admiring
glance
him
knew
was
the
one
who
should
keep
the
sword
must
say
glad
have
done
with
the
clumsy
thing
stop
interrupting
Taran
cried
Let
find
out
what
happened
friend
before
you
start
babbling
shall
not
weary
you
with
long
tale
Gwydion
said
You
already
know
Arawn
threat
has
been
turned
aside
may
strike
again
how
when
man
can
guess
But
for
the
moment
there
little
fear
What
Achren
Taran
asked
And
Spiral
Castle
was
not
Spiral
Castle
when
crumbled
Gwydion
said
Achren
took
from

and
bound

With
the
Cauldron
Born

castle
Oeth

Gwydion

when
Arawn
held

over
Prydain
place
death
its
walls

filled
with
human
bones
could
foresee
the
torments
Achren
had
planned
for
Yet
before
she
thrust
into
its
dungeons
she
gripped
arm
Why
you
choose
death
Lord
Gwydion
she
cried
when
can
offer
you
eternal
life
and
power
beyond
the
grasp

Prydain
long
before

was

made
him
king
over
Annuvin
was
who
gave
him
power
though
used

But
now
you
desire
you
shall
take
your
place
the
high
throne
Arawn
himself
and
rule
his
stead
Gladly
will
overthrow
Arawn
answered
And
will
use
those
powers
destroy

Raging

the

dungeon
Gwydion
said

never

death
than
Oeth

How
long
lay
there
cannot
sure
Gwydion
continued
Oeth
Anoeth
time
not
you
know
here
better
that
not
speak
the
torments
Achren
had
devised
The
worst
were
not
the
body
but
the
spirit
and
these
the
most
painful
was
despair
Yet
even
deepest
anguish
clung
hope
For
there
this
about
Oeth
Anoeth:
man
withstand
even
death
will
give
its
secrets
him
withstood
Gwydion
said
quietly
and
the
end
much
was
revealed
which
before
had
been
clouded
this
too
shall
not
speak
enough
for
you
know
that
understood
the
workings
life
and
death
laughter
and
tears
endings
and
beginnings
saw
the
truth
the
world
and
knew
chains
could
hold
bonds
were
light
dreams
that
moment
the
walls
prison
melted
What
became
Achren
Eilonwy
asked

Gwydion
said
did
not
see
her
thereafter
For
some
days
lay
concealed
the
forest

the
injuries
body
Spiral
Castle
was
ruins
when
returned
seek
you
and
there
mourned
your
death
mourned
yours
Taran
said
set
out
for
Caer
Dathyl
again
Gwydion
continued
For
time
followed
the
same
path
Fflewddur
chose
for
you
though
did
not
cross
the
valley
until
much
later
then
had
outdistanced
you
little
That
day
gwythaint
plunged
from
the
sky
and
flew
directly
toward
surprise
neither
attacked
nor
sped
away
after
had
seen
but
fluttered
before
crying
strangely
The
gwythaint
language
longer
secret
nor
the
speech

living
creature
and
understood

travelers
was
journeying
from
the
hills
nearby
and

accompanied
them
hastened

steps
then
Hen
Wen
sensed
was
close
hand
When
she
ran
from
you
Gwydion
said
Taran
she
ran
not
terror
but
find
What
learned
from
her
was
more
important
than
suspected
and
understood
why
Arawn
champion
sought
her
desperately
too
realized
she
knew
the
one
thing
that
could
destroy
him
What
was
that
Taran
asked
urgently
She
knew
the
Horned
King
secret
name
His
name
Taran
cried
astonishment
never
realized
name
could
powerful
Yes
Gwydion
answered
Once
you
have
courage
look
upon
evil
seeing
for
what
and
naming
its
true
name
powerless
against
you
and
you
can
destroy
Yet
with
all
understanding
said
reaching
down
and
scratching
the
white
pig
ear
could
not
have
discovered
the
Horned
King
name
without
Hen
Wen
Hen
Wen
told
this
secret
the
forest
had
need
letter
sticks
tomes
enchantment
for
could
speak
one
heart
and
mind
another
The
gwythaint
circling
overhead
led
the
Horned
King
The
rest
you
know
Where
the
gwythaint
now
asked
Taran
Gwydion
shook
his
head
not
know
But
doubt
she
will
ever
return
Annuvin
for
Arawn
would
rend
her
pieces
once
learned
what
she
had
done
only
know
she
has
repaid
your
kindness
the
fullest
measure
Rest
now
Gwydion
said
Later
shall
speak
happier
things
Lord
Gwydion
Eilonwy
called
rose
leave
what
was
the
Horned
King
secret
name
Gwydion
lined
face
broke
into
smile
must
remain
secret
said
then
patted
the
girl
gently
the
cheek
But
assure
you
was
not
half
pretty
your
own
FEW
DAYS
AFTERWARDS
when
Taran
had
regained
strength
enough
walk
unaided
Gwydion
accompanied
him
through
Caer
Dathyl
Standing
high
hill
the
fortress
alone
was
big
enough
hold
several
Caer
Dallbens
Taran
saw
armorers
shops
stables
for
the
steeds
warrior
breweries
weaving
rooms
Cottages
clustered
the
valleys
below
and
clear
streams
ran
golden
the
sunlight
Later
Gwydion
summoned
all
the
companions
the
great
hall
Caer
Dathyl
and
there
amid
banners
and
hedges
spears
they
received
the
gratitude
King
Math
Son
Mathonwy
ruler
the
House
Don
The
white
bearded
monarch
who
looked
old
Dallben
and
testy
was
even
more
talkative
than
Eilonwy
But
when
last
had
finished
one
the
longest
speeches
Taran
had
ever
heard
the
companions
bowed
and
guard
honor
bore
King
Math
from
the
hall
litter
draped
with
cloth
gold
Taran
and
his
friends
were
about
take
their
leave
Gwydion
called
them
These
are
small
gifts
for
great
valor
said
But
power
bestow
them
which
with
glad
heart
and
with
hope
that
you
will
treasure
them
not
much
for
their
value
for
the
sake

Fflewddur

Though

And
Taran

Here
Gwydion
paused
The
choice
his
reward
has
been
the
most
difficult
all
ask
reward
Taran
said

for
what
did
willingly
out

and
for

Gwydion
smiled
Taran
Caer
Dallben
said
you

touchy
and
headstrong

Believe
that

The

ones
but

Ask

Taran
bowed
his
head
spite
all
that
has
befallen
have
come

the

and

your
northern
lands
But
thoughts
have
turned

Gwydion
nodded

Chapter
Welcomes
THE
JOURNEY
CAER
DALLBEN
was
swift
and
unhindered
for
the
lords
the
southern
cantrevs
their
power
broken
had
slunk
back
each
his
own
tribe
throne
Taran
and
his
companions
with
Gwydion
himself
leading
rode
south
through
the
valley
Ystrad
Eilonwy
who
had
heard
much
Taran
talk
Coll
and
Dallben
would
not
denied
visit
and
she
too
rode
with
them
Gwydion
had
given
each
the
companions
handsome
steed
Taran
had
given
the
finest:
the
gray
silver
maned
stallion
Melynlas
the
lineage
Melyngar
and
swift
Hen
Wen
rode
triumphantly
horse
litter
looking
intensely
pleased
with
herself
Caer
Dallben
had
never
seen
joyous
welcome
though
this
time
Taran
was
not
positive
about
what
Dallben
had
had
not
seen
with
such
feasting
that
even
Gurgi
had
his
fill
for
once
Coll
embraced
Taran
who
was
amazed
that
such
hero
would
deign
remember
Assistant
Pig
Keeper
well
Eilonwy
Hen
Wen
and
anyone
else
could
get
his
hands
his
face
beamed
like
winter
fire
and
his
bald
crown
glowed
with
delight
Dallben
interrupted
his
meditations
present
the
feast
though
soon
after
the
festivities
withdrew
his
chamber
and
was
not
seen
for
some
time
Later
and
Gwydion
spent
several
hours
alone
for
there
were
important
matters
Gwydion
would
reveal
only
the
old
enchanter
Gurgi
making
himself
completely
home
snored
under
pile
hay
the
barn
While
Fflewddur
and
Doli
went
off
exploring
Taran
showed
Eilonwy
Hen
Wen
enclosure
where
the
pig
chuckled
and
grunted
happily
before
this
where
all
began
Eilonwy
said
don
want
sound
critical
but
don
think
you
should
have
had
all
that
trouble
keeping
her
Caer
Dallben
lovely
you
said
and
you
should
glad
home
she
went
like
suddenly
remembering
where
you
put
something
you
been
looking
for
Yes
suppose
Taran
said
leaning
the
railing
and
examining
closely
What
will
you
now
asked
Eilonwy
expect
you
back
Assistant
Pig
Keeping
Without
looking
Taran
nodded
Eilonwy
said
with
hesitation
was
hoping
mean
was
wondering
Before
could
finish
Coll
came
hurrying
and
whispered
that
Dallben
would
like
see
him
privately
Eilonwy
Taran
began
again
then
stopped
abruptly
and
strode
off
the
cottage
When
entered
the
chamber
Dallben
was
writing
with
great
quill
The
Book
Three
soon
saw
Taran
shut
the
volume
quickly
and
put
aside
Well
now
Dallben
said
should
like
the
two
speak
quietly
each
other
First
interested
learn
what
you
think
being
hero
daresay
you
feel
rather
proud
yourself
Although
added
not
gain
that
impression
from
your
face
have
just
cause
for
pride
Taran
said
taking
his
usual
place
the
familiar
bench
was
Gwydion
who
destroyed
the
Horned
King
and
Hen
Wen
helped
him
But
Gurgi
not
found
her
Doli
and
Fflewddur
fought
gloriously
while
was
wounded
sword
had
right
draw
And
Eilonwy
was
the
one
who
took
the
sword
from
the
barrow
the
first
place
for
what
mostly
did
was
make
mistakes
said
Dallben
those
are
complaints
enough
dampen
the
merriest
feast
Though
what
you
say
may
true
you
have
cause
for
certain
pride
nevertheless
was
you
who
held
the
companions
together
and
led
them
You
did
what
you
set
out
and
Hen
Wen
safely
back
with
you
made
mistakes
you
recognize
them
told
you
there
are
times
when
the
seeking
counts
more
than
the
finding
Does
truly
matter
Dallben
went
which
you
did
what
since
all
shared
the
same
goal
and
the
same
danger
Nothing
ever
done
entirely
alone
There
part
everyone
else
you
all
people
should
know
that
From
what
hear
you
have
been
impetuous
your
friend
Fflewddur
have
been
told
among
other
things
night
when
you
dove
head
first
into
thornbush
And
you
have
certainly
felt
sorry
for
yourself
Gurgi
and
like
Doli
striven
for
the
impossible
Yes
admitted
Taran
but
that
not
all
that
troubles
have
dreamed
often
Caer
Dallben
and
love
and
you
and
Coll
more
than
ever
asked
for
nothing
better
than
home
and
heart
rejoices
Yet
curious
feeling
have
returned
the
chamber
slept
and
found
smaller
than
remember
The
fields
are
beautiful
yet
not
quite
recalled
them
And
troubled
for
wonder
now
stranger
own
home
Dallben
shook
his
head
that
you
shall
never
But
not
Caer
Dallben
which
has
grown
smaller
You
have
grown
bigger
That
the
way
And
there
Eilonwy
Taran
said
What
will
become
her
possible
you
would
let
her
stay
with
Dallben
pursed
his
lips
and
toyed
with
the
pages
The
Book
Three
all
rights
said
the
Princess
Eilonwy
should
returned
her
kinsmen
yes
she
princess
Did
she
not
tell
you
But
there
hurry
about
that
She
might
consent
stay
Perhaps
you
spoke
her
Taran
sprang
his
feet
shall
hurried
from
the
chamber
and
ran
Hen
Wen
enclosure
Eilonwy
was
still
there
watching
the
oracular
pig
with
interest
You
stay
Taran
cried
asked
Dallben
Eilonwy
tossed
her
head

she
said

ask
Yes
but

didn

You
