MONTHS
PASS
THE
undifferentiated
white
light
ancient
magic
fueled
survival
shelter
After
the
first
few
days
you
start
wrapping
cloth
around
your
eyes
when
you
tired
create
your
own
day
and
night
works
passably
Tonkee
arm
survives
the
reattachment
though
she
gets
bad
infection
one
point
which
Lerna
basic
antibiotics
seem
powerless
stop
She
lives
though
the
time
the
fever
and
livid
infection
lines
have
faded
her
fingers
have
lost
some
their
fine
movement
and
she
gets
phantom
tinglings
and
numbness
throughout
the
limb
Lerna
thinks
this
will
permanent
Tonkee
mutters
imprecations
about
sometimes
whenever
you
track
her
down
the
middle
core
sampling
whatever
she
doing
and
force
her
meet
with
the
Innovator
caste
head
Whenever
she
gets
too
free
with
the
carm
chopper
insults
you
remind
her
first
that
unleashing
piece
the
Evil
Earth
crawl
through
her
flesh
was
her
own
damned
fault
and
second
that
you
the
only
reason
Ykka
hasn
had
her
killed
yet
maybe
she
should
consider
shutting
She
does
but
she
still
ass
about
Nothing
ever
really
changes
the
Stillness
And
yet
sometimes
things
Lerna
forgives
you
for
being
monster
That
not
exactly
You
and
still
can
talk
about
Tirimo
easily
Still
heard
your
raging
fight
with
Ykka
all
through
the
surgery
that
performed
Tonkee
arm
and
that
means
something
him
Ykka
wanted
Tonkee
left
die
the
table
You
argued
for
her
life
and
won
Lerna
knows
now
that
there
more
you
than
death
You
not
sure
you
agree
with
that
assessment
but
relief
have
something
your
old
friendship
back
Hjarka
starts
courting
Tonkee
Tonkee
doesn
react
well
first
She
mostly
just
confused
when
gifts
dead
animals
and
books
start
appearing
the
apartment
brought
with
too
casual
cIn
case
that
big
brain
hers

You
the
one
who
has

Tonkee
that
Hjarka
decided
through
whatever
convoluted
set

big
woman
holds
dear

commless

social

pinnacle

Then
Tonkee
mostly
annoyed
complaining
about
cdistractions
and
cthe
vagaries
the
ephemeral
and
the
need
cdecenter

You
mostly
ignore
all
the
books
that
settle
the
issue
Hjarka
seems
pick
them
the
number
many
syllabled
words
their
spines
but
you
come
home
few
times
find
Tonkee
engrossed
them
Eventually
you
come
home
find
Tonkee
room
curtain
drawn
and
Tonkee
engrossed
Hjarka
the
sounds
from
beyond
would
suggest
You
didn
think
they
could

much

her
bum
arm
Huh
Perhaps
this
new
sense

Castrima
that
causes
Tonkee

trying
prove
her
worth

(Or
maybe
just

Ykka

says
that
Tonkee
isn

hardest

Whatever
the
reason
Tonkee
brings
the
council

that
she
worked
out:

tells
all

cForgetfulness

things

that
But

result
dementia
and
nerve

You
can
figure
out
the
rest
There
are

can
happen

and

The
only
choice
that
will
prevent
this
outcome
Tonkee
explains
cannibalism
Planting
more
beans
just
isn
enough
The
report
useful
information
but
nobody
really
wanted
hear
and
Ykka
doesn
like
Tonkee
any
better
for

Aside
from
the

however
Castrima

six
months
One

not

until
someone

dies
clear
the
way
for

You
get
into
another
fight
with
Ykka
about
that
because
you
know
full
well
she
meant
Alabaster
when
she
offhandedly
added
cShouldn
long
the
woman
Ykka
unapologetic:
She
did
mean
Alabaster
and
she
hopes

soon
because

Two
good
outcomes
result
from
that
fracas:
Everyone
trusts

more
after

without

and

But
because

male
Breeder
visits
you
few
days
after
you
bring
Tonkee
home
finish
recuperating
The
Breeder
ashblow

strong
shouldered
sloe

thing
and
very
interested
know
that
you

three
healthy
children
all
powerful
orogenes
flatters
you
talking
about
how
tall
and
strong
you
are
how
well
you
weathered
months
the
road
with
only
travel
rations
eat
and
hinting
that
you

forty

This
actually
makes
you
laugh
You
feel
old
the
world
and
this
pretty
fool
thinks
you
ready
crank
out
another
baby
You
turn
down
his
tacit
offer
with
smile
but
strange
having
that
conversation
with
him
Unpleasantly
familiar
When
the
Breeder
gone
you
think
Corundum
and
wake
Tonkee
throwing
cup
the
wall
and
screaming
the
top
your
lungs
Then
you
see
Alabaster
for
another
lesson
which
utterly
useless
because
you
spend
standing
before
him
and
trembling
utter
rage
filled
silence
After
five
minutes
this
wearily
says
cWhatever
the
rust
wrong
with
you
you
going
have
deal
with

stop
you
anymore
You
hate
him
for
longer
being
invincible
And
for
not
hating
you
Alabaster
suffers
another
bad
infection
during
these
six
months
survives
only
deliberately
stoning
what
left
his
legs
This
self
induced
surgery
stresses
his
body
that
his
few
bouts

time
shrink
half
hour
apiece
interspersed
with
long
stretches

weak
when
awake

thankfully
this
improves

Resist

but

enough
and
many
things
become
possible
That
far
cry
from
chaining
together
multiple
obelisks
though
and
you
know
you

Alabaster

mistakes
like
yours
and
then
you
are
gasping
and
back
within
yourself
and
babbling
before
you
quite
remember
what
words
mean
cCamp
fire
you
say
panting
little
Lerna
comes
over
and
crouches
front
you
taking
your
hands
and
checking
your
pulse
you
ignore
him
This
important
Basin
Ykka
gets
instantly
sitting
straight
and
tightening
her
jaw
Hjarka
too
she
not
stupid
Tonkee
would
never
put
with
her
She
curses
Lerna
frowns
and
Cutter
looks
all
you
rising
confusion
cDid
that
actually
mean
something
Asshole
cAn
army
you
snap
you
recover
But
words
are
hard
cTh
there
rusting

the
forest
basin
could
Sess
their
campfires
cHow
many
Ykka
already
getting
fetching
longknife
from
shelf
and
belting
round
her
thigh
Hjarka
gets
too
going
the
door
Ykka
apartment
and
pulling
open
the
curtain
You
hear
her
shouting
for
Esni
the
head
the
Strongbacks
The
Strongbacks
sometimes
scouting
and
supplement
the
Hunters
but
situation
like
this
they
are
charged
primarily
with
the
comm
defense
You
couldn
count
all
the
little
blots
heat
that
pinged
your
awareness
when
you
were
the
obelisk
but
you
try
guess
cMaybe
hundred
That
was
the
campfires
though
How
many
people
around
each
fire
You
guess
six
seven
apiece
Not
large
force
under
ordinary
circumstances
Any
decent
quartent
governor
could
field
army
ten
times
that
size
relatively
short
notice
During
Season
though
and
for

small

not

cTettehee
Cutter
breathes
sitting
back
gone
paler
than
usual
You
follow
him
though
Six
months
ago
the
stand
impaled
corpses
set
warn
off
the
forest
basin
The
comm
Tettehee
beyond
the
basin
near
the
mouth
the
river
that
wends
through
Castrima
territory
and
ultimately
empties
into
one
the
great
lakes
the
Somidlats
You
heard
nothing
from
Tettehee
months
and
the
trading
party
you
sent
past
the
warn
off
failed
return
This
army
must
have
hit
Tettehee
around
that
time
then
bunkered
down
there
for
while
sending
out
scouting
parties
mark
territory
Replenishing
stores
rebuilding
arms
healing
their
wounded
maybe
sending
some
their
spoils
back
north
Rennanis
Now
that
they
digested
Tettehee
they
the
march
again
And
somehow
they
know
Castrima
here
They
saying
hello
Ykka
heads
outside
and
shouts
alongside
Hjarka
and
within
few
minutes
someone
ringing
the
shake
alarm
and
shouting
for
gathering
the
household
heads
the
Flat
Top
You
never
heard
Castrima
shake
alarm
comm
full
roggas
and
more
annoying
than
you
expected
low
and
rhythmic
and
buzzy
You
understand
why:
Amid
bunch
crystalline
structures
ringing
bells
aren
the
best
idea
Still
You
and
Lerna
and
the
rest
follow
Ykka
she
strides
along
rope
bridge
and
around
two
larger
shafts
her
lips
pressed
together
and
face
grim
the
time
she
reaches
the
Flat
Top
there
small
crowd
already
there
the
time
she
yells
for
someone
stop
blowing
the
rusting
alarm
and
the
alarm
actually
stops
the
sheared
off
crystal
starting
look
dangerously
packed
with
murmuring
anxious
people
There
railing
but
still
Hjarka
shouts
Esni
and
Esni
turn
shouts
the
Strongbacks
amid
the
gathering
and
they
move
clumsily
turn
people
away
there
won
any
horrible
tragedies
distracting
from
the
possible
horrible
tragedy
that
looms
imminent
When
Ykka
raises
her
hands
for
attention
everyone
falls
silent
instantly
cThe
situation
she
begins
and
lays
everything
out
few
terse
sentences
You
respect
her
for
holding
nothing
back
You
respect
the
people
Castrima
too
for
doing
nothing
more
than
gasping
murmuring
alarm
and
not
panicking
But
then
they
are
all
good
stolid
commfolk
and
panic
has
always
been
frowned
upon
the
Stillness
The
lorists
tales
are
full
dire
warnings
about
those
who
cannot
master
their
fear
and
few
comms
will
grant
such
people
comm
names
unless
they
wealthy
influential
enough
push
the
issue
Those
things
tend
sort
themselves
out
once
Season
rolls
around
cRennanis
was
big
city
says
one
woman
once
Ykka
stopped
talking
cHalf
the
size
Yumenes
but
still
millions
people
Can
fight
that
cIt
Season
Hjarka
says
before
Ykka
can
reply
Ykka
shoots
her
dirty
look
but
Hjarka
shrugs
off
cWe
have
choice
cWe
can
fight
because
the
way
Castrima
built
Ykka
adds
throwing
Hjarka
one
last
quelling
look
cThey
can
exactly
come
from
the
rear
push
comes
shove
can
block
off
the
tunnels
then
nothing
can
get
down
here
can
wait
them
out
Not
forever
though
Not
when
the
comm
needs
both
hunting
and
trading
supplement
its
storecaches
and
water
gardens
You
respect
Ykka
for
not
saying
this
There
somewhat
relieved
stir
cDo
have
time
send
messenger
south
one
our
allied

Lerna
asks
You
can
feel
him
trying

around

cWould

snorts
the
last
question
Lots

But
cTrading

The
forest
basin
takes
days
get
across
with
small

big

will
take

weeks
maybe
Faster
they
force

but
that
stupid
and
dangerous
terrain
they
don
know
know
their

are
our

but
She
glances
you
cHow

You
caught
off

you
know

cThey

says
someone
voice
high
pitched
with
alarm
and
many
other
people
take
that
murmur
They
start
getting
louder
Ykka
raises
her
hands
again
but
this
time
only
some
the
assembled
people
quiet
the
rest
keep
speculating
calculating
and
you
catch
sight
few
people
breaking
for
the
bridges
clearly
intent
upon
making
their
own
plans
Ykka
damned
not
chaos
not
quite
panic
but
there
enough
fear
the
air
scent
faintly
bitter
You
get
intending

the
center
the
gathering
with
Ykka
try
add
your
voice
hers
calling
for
calm
But
you
stop
Because
someone
standing
the

you
intended

not

Antimony

Those

you
catch
blur
now
and
again
but
then
the
statue
there
watching
you
there
has
always
been
statue
stranger
that
position
sculpted
someone
long
ago
This
stone
eater
turning
keeps
turning
letting
everyone
see
and
hear
turn
watching
you
finally
register
its
presence
the
gray
granite
its
flesh
the
undifferentiated
slick
its
hair
the
slightly
greater
polish
its
eyes
Carefully
sculpted

and
its

finely
carved
with

adopt
This

obviously

allover
gray
the
first

you
have
seen
who
looks
like
nothing
more
than

except
that
moves
and
keeps
moving
everyone
falls
silent
surprise
taking
all
you
too
with
slight
smile
his
lips
holding
something
You
stare
the
gray
stone
eater
turns
and
your
mind
makes
out
the
oddly
shaped
bloody
thing
holds
recent
experience
that
makes
you
suddenly
realize
arm
small
arm
small
arm
still
partially
wrapped
cloth
that
familiar
the
jacket
that
you
bought
lifetime
ago
the

The
red
smeared
inhumanly
white

the

familiar
and
the
size
familiar

though
the

all
Hoa
Hoa

message
says
the
gray
stone
eater
The
voice
pleasant
tenor
His
mouth
does
not
move
and
the
words
echo
from
his
chest
This
least
feels
normal
insofar
you
are
currently
capable
feeling
normal
you
stare
down
that
dripping

Ykka

pulling
herself
out

Turn
His
gaze
settles
Hjarka
who
blinks
cYou

depleted
You

Well
that
sets
off
the
murmuring
Ykka
shuts
her
eyes
for
moment
pure
frustration
Hjarka
looks
around
angrily
wondering
who
has
betrayed
you
Cutter
says
cWould

With

Lerna
makes
tight

the

Cutter
Cutter
throws
slashing

Lerna
cWe

cBut
stupid

Ykka
says
Her
voice
deceptively
mild
but
the
part
your
mind
that
not
stunned
silence
that
arm
you
note
that
she
never
backed
Lerna
before
You
always
gotten
the
impression
she
doesn
much
like
him
and
that
mutual
she
too
cold
for
him
too
soft
for
her
This
significant
cIf
were
these
people
would
lie
take
all
north
and
shove
into
commless
buffer
shanty
somewhere
between

geyser
and
lava
lake
Equatorial
comms
have
done
that
before
especially
when
they
needed
labor
Why
should
believe
this
one
any
different
The
gray
stone
eater
tilts
his
head
Between
that
and
the
little
smile
his
lips
remarkably
human
gesture
look
that
says

cute
cWe

You

Ykka
has
retort

Then
drops

Ykka
breaks
uttering

Cutter

Lerna

grasps
the

what
the

has
just
done
cWhere
Hoa
you
ask
into

about
The

you
The

cDead
says
cAfter

cYou
lying
You
don
even
realize
you
angry
You
don
think
about
what
you
about
You
just
react
like
Damaya
the
crucibles
like
Syenite
the
beach
Everything
you
crystallizes
and
sharpens
and
your
awareness
facets
down
razor
point
and
you
weave
the
threads
that
you
barely
noticed
were
there
and
happens
just
like
with
Tonkee
arm
shiiiiing
You
slice
the
stone
eater
hand
off
and
Hoa
arm
drop
the
floor
People
gasp
There
blood
Hoa
arm
hits
the
crystal
with
loud
meaty
thud
heavier
than
looks
and
the
stone
eater
hand
makes
second
even
more
solid
clack
separating
from
the
arm
The
cross
section
its
wrist
undifferentiated
gray
The
stone
eater
does
not
seem
react
first
Then
you
sess
the
coalescence
something
like
the
silver
threads
magic
but
many
The
hand
twitches
then
leaps
into
the
air
returning
the
wrist
stump
pulled
strings
leaves
Hoa
arm
behind
Then
the
stone
eater
turns
fully
face
you
last
cGet
out
before
chop
you
into
more
pieces
than
you
can
put
back
together
you
say
voice
that
shakes
like
the
earth
The
gray
stone
eater
smiles
full
smile
eyes
crinkling
with
crow
feet
and
lips
drawing
back
from
diamond
teeth
and
marvel
marvels
actually
looks
like
smile
and
not
threat
display
Then
vanishes
falling
through
the
surface
the
crystal
For
instant
you
see
gray
shadow
within
the
crystal
translucence
his
shape
blurred
and
not
quite
humanoid
anymore
though
that
probably
the
angle
Then
faster
than
you
can
track
with
eyes
sessapinae
shoots
down
and
away
the
reverberating
wake
his
leaving
Ykka
takes
and
lets
out
deep
breath
cWell
she
says
looking
around
her
people
What
she
believes
her

cSounds
like
need
talk
There
uneasy
stir
You
don
want

You
hurry
forward
and
pick
Hoa
arm
The
thing
heavy
stone
you
have
put
your
legs
into
risk
your
lower
back
You
turn
and
people
move
out
your
way
and
you
hear
Lerna
say
cEssun
But
you
don
want
hear
him
either
There
are
threads
see
Silver
lines
that
only
you
can
see
flailing
and
curling
forth
from
the
arm
stump
but
they
shift
you
turn
Always
pointing
particular
direction
you
follow
them
one
follows
you
and
you
don
care
what
that
means
Not
the
moment
The
tendrils
lead
you
your
own
apartment
You
step
through
the
curtain
and
stop
Tonkee
not
home
Must
either
Hjarka
the
green
room
There
are
two
more
limbs
the
floor
front
you
bloody
stumps
with
diamond
bones
poking
forth
they
are
not
the
floor
they
are
the
floor
partially
submerged
one
down
the
thigh
the
other
just
calf
and
foot
Caught
climbing
out
There
are
twin
trails
blood
thick
enough
worrisome
over
the
homey
rug
that
you
bartered
one
Jija
old
flintknives
for
They
toward
your
room
you
follow
them
And
then
you
drop
the
arm
Fortunately
does
not
land
your
foot
What
left
Hoa
crawls
toward
the
floor
mattress
that
passes
for
your
bed
His
other
arm
also
gone
you
don
know
where
Hanks
his
hair
are
missing
pauses
when
you
come
hearing
sessing
you
and
lies
still
you
circle
him
and
see
that
his
lower
jaw
has
been
ripped
away
has
eyes
and
there
bite
just
above
his
temple
That
why
his
hair
missing
Something
has
bitten
into
his
skull
like
apple
incising
chunk
flesh
and
the
diamond
bone
underneath
You
can
see
what
inside
his
head
for
the
blood
That
good
would
frighten
you
you
did
not
immediately
understand
Beside
your
bed
the
little
cloth
wrapped
bundle
that
has
carried
since
Tirimo
You
hurry
open
bring
the
ruin
him
and
hunker
down
cCan
you
turn
over

For
moment
you
stymied
the

jaw
and
then
you
think
fuck
and
shove
one
the
stones
from
the
bundle
directly
into
the
ragged
hole
Hoa
throat
The
feel
his
flesh
warm
and
human
you
push
down
with
your
finger
until
the
muscles
his
swallowing
reflex
catch
(Your
gorge
rises
You
will
back
down
You
start
feed
him
another
but
after
few
breaths
begins
shiver
all
over
violently
You
don
realize
you
still
sessing
magic
until
suddenly
Hoa
body
becomes
alive
with
glimmering
silver
threads
all
them
whipping
about
and
curling
like
the
stinging
tentacles
ocean
creatures
from
lorists
tales
Hundreds
them
You
draw
back
alarm
but
Hoa
makes
raw
breathy
sound
and
you
think
maybe
means
more
You
push
another
stone
into
his
throat
and
then
another
There
weren
many
left
begin
with
When
you
down
only
three
you
hesitate
cYou
want
them
all
Hoa
hesitates
too
You
can
see
that
his
body
language
You
don
understand
why
needs
them
all
aside
from
that
lashing
magic
made
every
inch
him
alive
with
you
never
seen
anything
like
this
nothing
about
his
damaged
body
improving
Can
anyone
survive
recover
from
this
degree
damage
not
human
enough
for
you
even
guess
But
finally
croaks
again
deeper
sound
than
the
first
Resigned
maybe
maybe
that
your
imagination
patterning
humanity
over
the
animal
sounds
his
animal
flesh
you
push
the
last
three
stones
into
him
Nothing
happens
for
moment
Then
Silver
tendrils
billow
and
swell
around
him
rapidly
with
such
frenzy
that
you
scramble
back
You
know
some
the
things
that
magic
can
and
something
about
this
seems
altogether
wild
and
uncontrolled
fills
the
room
though
and
and
you
blink
You
can
see
not
just
sess
All
Hoa
glimmers
now
with
silver
white
light
growing
rapidly
too
bright
look
directly
even
still
would
able
see
this
You
move
into
the
living
room
peering
through
the
bedroom
door
because
that
seems
safer
The
instant
you
cross
the
room
threshold
the
substance
the
whole
apartment
walls
floor
everywhere
there
crystal
shivers
for
instant
becoming
translucent
and
obelisk
unreal
Your
bedroom
furniture
and
belongings
float
amid
the
flickering
white
There
soft
thump
from
behind
you
that
makes
you
jump
and
whirl
but
Hoa
legs
which
are
out
the
living
room
floor
and
sliding
along
the
trails
blood
into
your
room
The
arm
you
dropped
moving
too
already
nudging
against
the
bright
morass
him
becoming
bright
too
Leaping
rejoin
his
body
the
gray
stone
eater
hand
rejoined
his
wrist
Something
slides
from
the
floor
You
see
the
floor
slide
were
putty
and
not
crystal
and
wrap
itself
around
his
body
The
light
dies
when
does
the
material
immediately
begins
change
into
something
darker
When
you
blink
away
the
afterimages
enough
see
there
something
huge
and
strange
and
impossible
where
Hoa
once
was
You
step
back
into
the
bedroom
carefully
because
the
floor
and
walls
might
solid
again
but
you
know
that
possibly
temporary
state
The
once
smooth
crystal
rough
beneath
your
feet
The
thing
takes
most
the
room
now
lying
next
your
disordered
bed
that
now
half
submerged
the
resolidified
floor
hot
Your
foot
tangles
briefly
the
strap
your
half
empty
runny
sack
which
fortunately
still
intact
and
unmerged
with
the
room
You
stoop
quickly
and
grab
the
habits
survival
Earthfires
hot
here
The
bed
does
not
catch
fire
but
you
think
that
only
because
not
directly
touching
the
big
thing
You
can
sess
whatever
you
know
what
is:
chalcedony
huge
oblong
lump
gray
green
chalcedony
like
the
outer
shell
geode
You
already
know
what
happening
don
you
told
you
Tirimo
after
the
Rifting
The
far
end
the
valley
where
the
shockwave
the
shake
loosed
geode
that
then
split
open
like
egg
The
geode
hadn
been
there
all
along
you
realize
this
magic
not
nature
Well
perhaps
bit
both
For
stone
eaters
there
little
difference
between
the
two
And
the
morning
after
you
spend
the
night
the
living
room
table
where
you
meant
stay
awake
and
watch
the
steaming
lump
rock
but
instead
fell
asleep
happens
again
The
cracking
open
the
geode
loud
explosively
violent
flicker
pressure
driven
plasma
curls
forth
and
scorches
melts
all
the
belongings
you
left
the
room
Except
the
runny
sack
since
you
took
Good
instincts
You
shaking
from
being
startled
awake
Slowly
you
stand
and
edge
into
the
room
hot
that
hard
breathe
Like
oven
though
the
waft
warmth
causes
the
apartment
entry
curtain
billow
open
Quickly
the
heat
diminishes
only
uncomfortable
and
not
dangerous
You
barely
notice
Because
what
rises
from
the
split
the
geode
moving
too
human
smoothly
first
but
rapidly
readjusting
familiar
sort
punctuated
stillness
the
stone
eater
from
the
garnet
obelisk
